   abstract = {ConspectusThe structural degrees of freedom of a solid material are the various distortions most straightforwardly activated by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or adsorption. One of the most successful design strategies in materials chemistry involves controlling these individual distortions to produce useful collective functional responses. In a ferroelectric such as lead titanate, for example, the key degree of freedom involves asymmetric displacements of Pb(2+) and Ti(4+) cations; it is by coupling these together that the system as a whole interacts with external electric fields. Collective rotations of the polyhedral units in oxide ceramics are another commonly exploited distortion, driving anomalous behavior such as negative thermal expansion-the counterintuitive phenomenon of volume contraction on heating. An exciting development in the field has been to take advantage of the interplay between different distortion types: generating polarization by combining two different polyhedral rotations, for example. In this way, degrees of freedom act as geometric "elements" that can themselves be combined to engineer materials with new and interesting properties. Just as the discovery of new chemical elements quite obviously diversified chemical space, we might expect that identifying new and different types of structural degrees of freedom to be an important strategy for developing new kinds of functional materials. In this context, the broad family of molecular frameworks is emerging as an extraordinarily fertile source of new and unanticipated distortion types, the vast majority of which have no parallel in the established families of conventional solid-state chemistry.Framework materials are solids whose structures are assembled from two fundamental components: nodes and linkers. Quite simply, linkers join the nodes together to form scaffolding-like networks that extend from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. These structures usually contain cavities, which can also accommodate additional ions for charge balance. In the well-established systems-such as lead titanate-node, linker, and extra-framework ions are all individual atoms (Ti, O, and Pb, respectively). But in molecular frameworks, at least one of these components is a molecule.In this Account, we survey the unconventional degrees of freedom introduced through the simple act of replacing atoms by molecules. Our motivation is to understand the role these new distortions play (or might be expected to play) in different materials properties. The various degrees of freedom themselves-unconventional rotational, translational, orientational, and conformational states-are summarized and described in the context of relevant experimental examples. The much-improved prospect for generating emergent functionalities by combining these new distortion types is then discussed. We highlight a number of directions for future research-including the design and application of hierarchically structured phases of matter intermediate to solids and liquid crystals-which serve to highlight the extraordinary possibilities for this nascent field.},

   abstract = {The recent re-emergence of the halide perovskites, of the type AMX3, derives from a sea-changing breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics that has led to a whole new generation of solar devices with remarkable power conversion efficiency. The success in the field of photovoltaics has led to intense, combined research efforts to better understand these materials both from the fundamental chemistry and physics points of view and for the improvement of applied functional device engineering. This groundswell of activity has breathed new life into this long-known but largely "forgotten" class of perovskites. The impressive achievements of halide perovskites in photovoltaics, as well as other optoelectronic applications, stem from an unusually favorable combination of optical and electronic properties, with the ability to be solution processed into films. This defines them as a brand new class of semiconductors that can rival or exceed the performance of the venerable classes of III-V and II-IV semiconductors, which presently dominate the industries of applied optoelectronics. Our aim in this Account is to highlight the basic pillars that define the chemistry of the halide perovskites and their unconventional electronic properties through the prism of structure-property relationships. We focus on the synthetic requirements under which a halide perovskite can exist and emphasize how the synthetic conditions can determine the structural integrity and the bulk properties of the perovskites. Then we proceed to discuss the origins of the optical and electronic phenomena, using the perovskite crystal structure as a guide. Some of the most remarkable features of the perovskites dealt with in this Account include the evolution of a unique type of defect, which gives rise to superlattices. These can enhance or diminish the fluorescence properties of the perovskites. For example, the exotic self-doping ability of the Sn-based perovskites allows them to adopt electrical properties from semiconducting to metallic. We attempt to rationalize how these properties can be tuned and partially controlled through targeted synthetic procedures for use in electronic and optical devices. In addition, we address open scientific questions that pose big obstacles in understanding the fundamentals of perovskites. We anticipate that the answers to these questions will provide the impetus upon which future research directions will be founded.},

Although pyrrole is the most electron-rich five-membered heteroaromatic ring, it has found few applications in organic photovoltaics and organic field-effect transistors due to synthetic challenges and instability. However, computational modeling assisted screening processes have indicated that relatively stable materials containing pyrrolic units can be synthesized without compromising their inherent electron-donating properties. In this work, we provide a complete, up-to-date review of pyrrole-containing semiconducting materials used for organic photovoltaics and organic field-effect transistors and highlight recent advances in the synthesis of these materials.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the phase formation mechanism of formamidinium (FA)-based Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites is uncovered for the first time, which includes the formation of the n(1) domain (n = 1 perovskite phase) and a trace amount of the large n domain in the spin-coating process and the growth of the n(2) domain and the large n domain during the thermal annealing stage. The phase formation mechanism clearly reveals the different phase distributions between FA-based Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) and FA-based DJ perovskite films at different stages of film preparation due to the larger formation energy of the DJ perovskites. According to this phase formation mechanism, we put forward an effective strategy of the small A-site cation compositional engineering. Then, excess perovskitizer cations (FA(+)) are introduced to increase the crystallinity, modulate the phase distribution and passivate defects without disturbing the structure of DJ perovskites simultaneously. The final green-light DJ PeLED devices show a maximum luminance of 41 520 cd/m(2) and a maximum current efficiency of 31.1 cd/A (EQE: 8.5%), which are the record values so far. The final DJ PeLEDs show an improved operational lifetime of ca. 15 min at an initial luminance of ca. 800 cd/m(2). Our results suggest that DJ perovskites can be promising for light-emitting applications.},

   abstract = {Organic-inorganic perovskites face the issues of being vulnerable to oxygen and moisture and the trap sites located at the surface and grain boundaries. Integration of two-dimensional (2D) perovskites as a capping layer is an effective route to enhance both photovoltaic efficiency and environmental stability of the three-dimensional (3D) underlayer. Here, we employ 1,4-butanediammonium diiodide (BDADI), which has a short chain length and diammonium cations, to construct a 3D/2D stacking perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The introduction of BDA(2+) could passivate surface defects in 3D perovskites by forming 2D Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phase perovskites and effectively suppressing nonradiative recombination, thus resulting in a longer carrier lifetime. The DJ 2D capping layer also regulate the energy level arrangement, enabling a better charge extraction and transport process. In addition, the water-resistance ability of 3D perovskite gets improved because of the hydrophobic characteristic of 1,4-butanediammonium cations. Consequently, the 3D/2D stacking PSCs yield an energy conversion efficiency of 20.32% in company with the enhanced long-term stability.},

   abstract = {The stability and formation of a perovskite structure is dictated by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor as a general geometric guideline. The tolerance factor has limited the choice of cations (A) in 3D lead iodide perovskites (APbI(3)), an intriguing class of semiconductors for high-performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Here, we show the tolerance factor requirement is relaxed in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites, enabling the incorporation of a variety of larger cations beyond the methylammonium (MA), formamidinium, and cesium ions in the lead iodide perovskite cages for the first time. This is unequivocally confirmed with the single-crystal X-ray structure of newly synthesized guanidinium (GA)-based (n-C(6)H(13)NH(3))(2)(GA)Pb(2)I(7), which exhibits significantly enlarged and distorted perovskite cage containing sterically constrained GA cation. Structural comparison with (n-C(6)H(13)NH(3))(2)(MA)Pb(2)I(7) reveals that the structural stabilization originates from the mitigation of strain accumulation and self-adjustable strain-balancing in 2D RP structures. Furthermore, spectroscopic studies show a large A cation significantly influences carrier dynamics and exciton-phonon interactions through modulating the inorganic sublattice. These results enrich the diverse families of perovskite materials, provide new insights into the mechanistic role of A-site cations on their physical properties, and have implications to solar device studies using engineered perovskite thin films incorporating such large organic cations.},

   abstract = {We report a method to convert discrete representations of molecules to and from a multidimensional continuous representation. This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in a set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.},

   abstract = {Crafting rational heterojunctions with nanostructured materials is instrumental in fostering effective interfacial charge separation and transport for optoelectronics. Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) that form heterojunctions between organic spacer molecules and inorganic metal halide layers exhibit tunable photophysics owing to their customizable band alignment. However, controlling photogenerated carrier dynamics by strategically designing layered perovskite heterojunctions remains largely unexplored. We combine a data-driven approach with time-domain density functional theory (TD-DFT) and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) to screen and select electronically active spacer dications (A') that introduce a type-II heterojunction in the lead iodide-based Dion-Jacobson phase LHPs. The composition-structure-electronic property correlations reveal that the number of nitrogens in aromatic heterocycles is the key factor in designing electron-accepting spacers in these perovskites. The detailed atomistic simulations validate the design strategy further by modeling (A')PbI(4) perovskites, which incorporate three different screened electroactive A' spacers. The computed excited charge carrier dynamics illustrate the phonon-mediated ultrafast interfacial electron transfer from the inorganic conduction band edge to the lower-lying unoccupied orbitals of spacers, exhibiting photoluminescence quenching in these (A')PbI(4) perovskites. The spatially separated electrons and holes at the type-II heterojunction interface prolong the excited charge carrier lifetime, boosting the carrier transport and exciton dynamics. Our work illustrates a robust in silico approach for designing LHPs with exciting optoelectronic properties originating from their fine-tuned heterojunctions.},

Increasingly, the bottleneck in this field is the synthesis of these materials. Although theoretical calculations have predicted a myriad of promising 2D materials, only a few dozen have been experimentally realized since the initial discovery of graphene. Here, we adapt the state-of-the-art positive and unlabeled (PU) machine learning framework to predict which theoretically proposed 2D materials have the highest likelihood of being successfully synthesized. Using elemental information and data from high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we apply the PU learning method to the MXene family of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, and their layered precursor MAX phases, and identify 18 MXene compounds that are highly promising candidates for synthesis. By considering both the MXenes and their precursors, we further propose 20 synthesizable MAX phases that can be chemically exfoliated to produce MXenes.},

   abstract = {Ligands play a critical role in the optical properties and chemical stability of colloidal nanocrystals (NCs), but identifying ligands that can enhance NC properties is daunting, given the high dimensionality of chemical space. Here, we use machine learning (ML) and robotic screening to accelerate the discovery of ligands that enhance the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of CsPbBr(3) perovskite NCs. We developed a ML model designed to predict the relative PL enhancement of perovskite NCs when coordinated with a ligand selected from a pool of 29,904 candidate molecules. Ligand candidates were selected using an active learning (AL) approach that accounted for uncertainty quantified by twin regressors. After eight experimental iterations of batch AL (corresponding to 21 initial and 72 model-recommended ligands), the uncertainty of the model decreased, demonstrating an increased confidence in the model predictions. Feature importance and counterfactual analyses of model predictions illustrate the potential use of ligand field strength in designing PL-enhancing ligands. Our versatile AL framework can be readily adapted to screen the effect of ligands on a wide range of colloidal nanomaterials.},

   abstract = {Layered halide hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOP) have been the subject of intense investigation before the rise of three-dimensional (3D) HOP and their impressive performance in solar cells. Recently, layered HOP have also been proposed as attractive alternatives for photostable solar cells and revisited for light-emitting devices. In this review, we combine classical solid-state physics concepts with simulation tools based on density functional theory to overview the main features of the optoelectronic properties of layered HOP. A detailed comparison between layered and 3D HOP is performed to highlight differences and similarities. In the same way as the cubic phase was established for 3D HOP, here we introduce the tetragonal phase with D(4h) symmetry as the reference phase for 2D monolayered HOP. It allows for detailed analysis of the spin-orbit coupling effects and structural transitions with corresponding electronic band folding. We further investigate the effects of octahedral tilting on the band gap, loss of inversion symmetry and possible Rashba effect, quantum confinement, and dielectric confinement related to the organic barrier, up to excitonic properties. Altogether, this paper aims to provide an interpretive and predictive framework for 3D and 2D layered HOP optoelectronic properties.},

   abstract = {Layered hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOPs) have re-emerged as potential technological solutions for next-generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Their two-dimensional (2D) nature confers them a significant flexibility and results in the appearance of quantum and dielectric confinements. Such confinements are at the origin of their fascinating properties, and understanding them from a fundamental level is of paramount importance for optimization. Here, we provide an in-depth investigation of band alignments of 2D HOP allowing access to carriers' confinement potentials. 2D HOPs are conceptualized as composite materials in which pseudoinorganic and -organic components are defined. In this way, computational modeling of band alignments becomes affordable using first-principles methods. First, we show that the composite approach is suitable to study the position-dependent dielectric profiles and enables clear differentiation of the respective contributions of inorganic and organic components. Then we apply the composite approach to a variety of 2D HOPs, assessing the impact on the confinement potentials of well and barrier thickness, of the nature of the inorganic well, and of structural transitions. Using the deduced potentials, we further discuss the limitations of the effective mass approximation, scrutinizing the electronic properties of this family of composite materials. Our simulations demonstrate type-I dominant band alignment in 2D HOPs. Finally, we outline design principles on band alignment toward achieving specific optoelectronic properties. Thus, we present alternative theoretical methods to inspect the properties of 2D hybrid perovskites and expect that the composite approach will be applicable to other classes of layered materials.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with natural multi-quantum-well structure have been reported to offer better stability compared to 3D perovskites. However, the understanding of the exciton separation and transport mechanism in 2D perovskites and developing more efficient organic spacers remain considerable challenges, as the 2D perovskites exhibit large exciton binding energy due to quantum confinement. Here, a class of multiple-ring aromatic ammoniums, 1-naphthalenemethylammonium (NpMA) and 9-anthracenemethylammonium (AnMA), was developed as spacers for 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In addition to significantly enhanced stability, the device based on (NpMA)(2)(MA)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (average n = 4) exhibits a champion efficiency of 17.25% and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.24 V. The outstanding photovoltaic performance could be ascribed to the ultrafast exciton migration (within 7 ps) from 2D phases to 3D-like phases, which were confirmed by charge carrier dynamics results, leading to efficient exciton separation, charge transportation, and collection. This work facilitates understanding the working mechanism of 2D PSCs in-depth and offers an efficient way to further boost their efficiency and stability by developing multiple-ring aromatic spacers.},

   abstract = {Hot carrier (HC) cooling is a critical photophysical process that significantly influences the optoelectronic performance of hybrid perovskite-based devices. The hot carrier extraction at the device interface is very challenging because of its ultrashort lifetime. Here, ultrafast transient reflectance spectroscopy measurements and time-domain ab initio calculations show how the dielectric constant of the organic spacers can control and slow the HC cooling dynamics in single-crystal 2D Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid perovskites. We find that (EA)(2)PbI(4) (EA = HOC(2)H(4)NH(3)(+)) that correspond to a high dielectric constant organic spacer has a longer HC cooling time compared to that of (AP)(2)PbI(4) (AP = HOC(3)H(6)NH(3)(+)) and (PEA)(2)PbI(4) (PEA = C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3)(+)). The slow HC relaxation process in the former case can be ascribed to a stronger screening of the Coulomb interactions, a small nonradiative internal conversion within the conduction bands, as well as a weak electron-phonon coupling. Our findings provide a strategy to prolong the hot carrier cooling time in low-dimensional hybrid perovskite materials by using organic spacers with reduced dielectric confinement.},

   abstract = {Colloidal lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have recently emerged as one of the most promising light-emitting materials for optoelectronic devices with outstanding performance. However, the facile detachment of surface capping organic ligands from these NCs leads to very poor colloidal stability and durability. This is mainly due to the weak interfacial interactions between the inorganic perovskite core and ligands, high density of surface defect states, and aggregation of NCs. Here, using a combination of time-resolved laser spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored the major impact of surface orientations and terminations for both CsPbBr(3) and Cs(4)PbBr(6) NCs not only on the interfacial binding affinities with organic ligands but also on surface defect formation and NC aggregation. By rationalizing that surface trap states are responsible for the decrease in photoluminescence (PL) upon fabrication and purification, we propose a powerful ligand-engineering strategy for eliminating these trap states and preventing the aggregation of CsPbBr(3) and Cs(4)PbBr(6) NCs. Interestingly, we find that the surface orientation and dimensionality determine the degree of interfacial interactions between the inorganic perovskite core and ligands and subsequently control the overall PL intensity and NC stability. Our results demonstrate that a treatment of as-synthesized CsPbBr(3) NCs consisting of the addition of extra oleylammonium bromide (OAmBr) as a capping ligand, allows the CsPbBr(3) NCs to retain their green emission with increased PL intensity and quantum yields and improves colloidal durability. On the other hand, the ultraviolet emissions of Cs(4)PbBr(6) NCs are effectively increased upon addition of extra cesium oleate (CsOL) as the trap states induced by surface cesium ions are largely reduced by the formation of Cs-O bonds. Our work provides a robust and adequate ligand engineering approach to significantly enhance the optical behavior of perovskite NCs with different dimensionalities and various compositions and to achieve more efficient and stable light-harvesting devices.},

   abstract = {2D Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskite solar cells generally show mediocre device performances as they are restrained by their defective film quality. The rigid diammonium organic interlayer spacers are intolerant to lattice mismatches, which induces defects and distortions and ultimately deteriorates the optoelectronic properties. Herein, a secondary interlayer spacer is introduced into formamidinium (FA)-based low-dimensional perovskite, which substantially improves the film quality. The flexible monovalent spacer cations effectively alleviate lattice distortions and reduce crystal defects, providing perovskite films with desirable microscopic morphology, preferable crystal orientation, reduced defect states, and improved charge transport capability. As a result, the optimized perovskite solar cell based on the (PDA(0.9) PA(0.2) )(FA)(3) Pb(4) I(13) (PDA = propane-1,3-diammonium, PA = propylammonium) film exhibits the exceptional power conversion efficiency of 16.0%, the highest reported value in its class. In addition, the device demonstrates the enhanced thermal stability, retaining 90% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85 degrees C for 800 h.},

   abstract = {Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are considered as particularly attractive candidates for high-quality lighting and displays, due to possessing the features of wide gamut and real color expression. However, most PeLEDs are made from polycrystalline perovskite films that contain a high concentration of defects, including point and extended imperfections. Reducing and mitigating non-radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light-emitting applications. Here, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) is introduced as a functional additive dissolved in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process. The ETPTA can effectively decrease the charge trapping states by passivation and/or suppression of defects. Eventually, the perovskite films that are sufficiently passivated by ETPTA make the devices achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.49%. To our knowledge, these are the most efficient green PeLEDs up to now. In addition, a threefold increase in the T(50) operational time of the devices was observed, compared to control samples. These findings provide a simple and effective strategy to make highly efficient perovskite polycrystalline films and their optoelectronics devices.},

   abstract = {2D Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have become emerging photovoltaic materials owing to their intrinsic structure stability. However, as insulating aliphatic cations are widely used as spacers, the interactions between the spacers and inorganic layers in DJ perovskites have rarely been studied. Here, an organic semiconductor spacer with two covalently connected thiophene rings, namely bithiophene dimethylammonium (BThDMA), is successfully developed for 2D DJ perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An important finding is that there are strong orbital interactions between the conjugated organic spacer and adjacent inorganic layers, whereas no such interactions exist in DJ perovskite using an aliphatic octane-1,8-diaminium (ODA) spacer with similar length. The BThDMA spacer with multiple conjugated aromatic rings can also induce crystal growth with large grain size and preferred vertical orientation, resulting in reduced trap density and improved charge-carrier mobility. As a result, the optimized device based on (BThDMA)MA(n) (-1) Pb(n) I(3) (n) (+1) (nominal n = 5) shows an excellent PCE of 18.1% with negligible hysteresis, which is a record efficiency for 2D DJ PSCs using a spacer with two or more covalently linked aromatic rings. These findings provide a novel and important insight on achieving efficient and stable 2D DJ perovskite solar cells by developing organic semiconductor spacers.},

Here, high photovoltaic performance is demonstrated for quasi-2D RP PSCs using 2-thiophenemethylammonium as spacer with nominal n-value of 5, which is based on the stoichiometry of the precursors. The incorporation of formamidinium (FA) in quasi-2D RP perovskites reduces the bandgap and improves the light absorption ability, resulting in enlarged photocurrent and an increased PCE of 16.18%, which is higher than that of reported analogous methylammonium (MA)-based quasi-2D PSC ( approximately 15%). A record high PCE of 19.06% is further demonstrated by using an organic salt, namely, 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzylammonium iodide, assisted crystal growth (OACG) technique, which can induce the crystal growth and orientation, tune the surface energy levels, and suppress the charge recombination losses. More importantly, the devices based on OACG-processed quasi-2D RP perovskites show remarkable environmental stability and thermal stability, for example, the PCE retaining approximately 96% of its initial value after storage at 80 degrees C for 576 h, while only approximately 37% of the original efficiency left for FAPbI(3) -based 3D PSCs.},

   abstract = {2D ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors/half-metals/metals are the key materials toward next-generation spintronic devices. However, such materials are still rather rare and the material search space is too large to explore exhaustively. Here, an adaptive framework to accelerate the discovery of 2D intrinsic FM materials is developed, by combining advanced machine-learning (ML) techniques with high-throughput density functional theory calculations. Successfully, about 90 intrinsic FM materials with desirable bandgap and excellent thermodynamic stability are screened out and a database containing 1459 2D magnetic materials is set up. To improve the performance of ML models on small-scale datasets like diverse 2D materials, a crystal graph multilayer descriptor using the elemental property is proposed, with which ML models achieve prediction accuracy over 90% on thermodynamic stability, magnetism, and bandgap. This study not only provides dozens of compelling FM candidates for future spintronics, but also paves a feasible route for ML-based rapid screening of diverse structures and/or complex properties.},

   abstract = {2D perovskites stabilized by alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) represent a very new entry as highly efficient semiconductors for solar cells approaching 15% power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, further improvements will require understanding of the nature of the films, e.g., the thickness distribution and charge-transfer characteristics of ACI quantum wells (QWs), which are currently unknown. Here, efficient control of the film quality of ACI 2D perovskite (GA)(MA)(n) Pb(n) I(3) (n) (+1) (<n> = 3) QWs via incorporation of methylammonium chloride as an additive is demonstrated. The morphological and optoelectronic characterizations unambiguously demonstrate that the additive enables a larger grain size, a smoother surface, and a gradient distribution of QW thickness, which lead to enhanced photocurrent transport/extraction through efficient charge transfer between low-n and high-n QWs and suppressed nonradiative charge recombination. Therefore, the additive-treated ACI perovskite film delivers a champion PCE of 18.48%, far higher than the pristine one (15.79%) due to significant improvements in open-circuit voltage and fill factor. This PCE also stands as the highest value for all reported 2D perovskite solar cells based on the ACI, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Dion-Jacobson families. These findings establish the fundamental guidelines for the compositional control of 2D perovskites for efficient photovoltaics.},

   abstract = {2D perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic materials owing to their excellent stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, in typical 2D perovskites, the highly conductive inorganic layers are isolated by large organic cations leading to quantum confinement and thus inferior electrical conductivity across layers. To address this issue, the large organic cations are replaced with small propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA) cations to reduce distance between the inorganic perovskite layers. As shown by optical characterizations, quantum confinement is no longer dominating in the PDA-based 2D perovskites. This leads to considerable enhancement of charge transport as confirmed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence, and mobility measurements. The improved electric properties of the interlayer-engineered 2D perovskites yield a power conversion efficiency of 13.0%. Furthermore, environmental stabilities of the PDA-based 2D perovskites are improved. PDA-based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with encapsulation can retain over 90% of their efficiency upon storage for over 1000 h, and PSCs without encapsulation can maintain their initial efficiency at 70 degrees C for over 100 h, which exhibit promising stabilities. These results reveal excellent optoelectronic properties and intrinsic stabilities of the layered perovskites with reduced interlayer distance.},

   abstract = {Chiral materials with intrinsic inversion-symmetric structures possess many unique physicochemical features, including circular dichroism, circularly polarized photoluminescence, nonlinear optics, ferroelectricity, and spintronics. Halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties, which are particularly suitable for realizing high power-conversion efficiency in solar cells. Recent studies have shown that chirality can be transferred from chiral organic ligands into halide perovskites and the resultant chiral perovskites combine the advantages of both chiral materials and halide perovskites; this provides an ideal platform to design next-generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. In this progress report, the most recent advances are summarized in various chemical structures of chiral perovskites, their synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, and physical properties. Furthermore, the potential chiral-halide-perovskite-based applications are presented and the challenges and prospects of chiral perovskites are discussed. This report outlines the diverse construction strategies of and proposes research directions for chiral halide perovskites; thus, it provides insights into the design of novel chiral perovskites and facilitates investigation of the optoelectronic applications that employ chirality.},

To fully exploit their functionality, mechanical stimuli can be used to control their properties without changing the composition. However, the responsiveness of these systems to pressure compatible with practical applications (<1 GPa) remains unexploited. Hydrostatic pressure is used to investigate the structure-property relationships in representative iodide and bromide DJ and RP 2D perovskites based on 1,4-phenylenedimethylammonium (PDMA) and benzylammonium (BzA) spacers in the 0-0.35 GPa pressure range. Pressure-dependent X-ray scattering measurements reveal that lattices of these compositions monotonically shrink and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the structural changes within the organic spacer layer. These structural changes affect the optical properties; the most significant shift in the optical absorption is observed in (BzA)(2) PbBr(4) under 0.35 GPa pressure, which is attributed to an isostructural phase transition. Surprisingly, the RP and DJ perovskites behave similarly under pressure, despite the different binding modes of the spacer molecules. This study provides important insights into how the manipulation of the crystal structure affects the optoelectronic properties of such materials, whereas the reversibility of their response expands the perspectives for future applications.},

   abstract = {Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D-like phase to 2D phases, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA-based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier-diffusion length ( approximately 1.98 microm). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow delta-phase formation of pure FA-based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA-based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA-based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low-dimensional PSCs (n </= 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA-based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85 degrees C persistent heating after 1500 h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure-FA-based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.},

   abstract = {Low-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites (RPPs) exhibit excellent stability in comparison with 3D perovskites; however, the relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) limits their future application. In this work, a new fluorine-substituted phenylethlammonium (PEA) cation is developed as a spacer to fabricate quasi-2D (4FPEA)(2) (MA)(4) Pb(5) I(16) (n = 5) perovskite solar cells. The champion device exhibits a remarkable PCE of 17.3% with a J(sc) of 19.00 mA cm(-2) , a V(oc) of 1.16 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 79%, which are among the best results for low-dimensional RPP solar cells (n </= 5). The enhanced device performance can be attributed as follows: first, the strong dipole field induced by the 4-fluoro-phenethylammonium (4FPEA) organic spacer facilitates charge dissociation. Second, fluorinated RPP crystals preferentially grow along the vertical direction, and form a phase distribution with the increasing n number from bottom to the top surface, resulting in efficient charge transport. Third, 4FPEA-based RPP films exhibit higher film crystallinity, enlarged grain size, and reduced trap-state density. Lastly, the unsealed fluorinated RPP devices demonstrate superior humidity and thermal stability. Therefore, the fluorination of the long-chain organic cations provides a feasible approach for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of low-dimensional RPP solar cells.},

As the physical properties of the materials are being explored, it is becoming apparent that the photovoltaic performance of the halide perovskites is just but one aspect of the wealth of opportunities that these compounds offer as high-performance semiconductors. From unique optical and electrical properties stemming from their characteristic electronic structure to highly efficient real-life technological applications, halide perovskites constitute a brand new class of materials with exotic properties awaiting discovery. The nature of halide perovskites from the materials' viewpoint is discussed here, enlisting the most important classes of the compounds and describing their most exciting properties.

   abstract = {Layered Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase (2D) halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention due to the wide tunability on their optoelectronic properties and excellent robustness in photovoltaic devices. However, charge extraction/transport and ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE) in 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by the non-eliminable quantum well effect. Here, a slow post-annealing (SPA) process is proposed for BA(2) MA(3) Pb(4) I(13) (n = 4) 2D PSCs by which a champion PCE of 17.26% is achieved with simultaneously enhanced open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor. Investigation with optical spectroscopy coupled with structural analyses indicates that enhanced crystal orientation and favorable alignment on the multiple perovskite phases (from the 2D phase near bottom to quasi-3D phase near top regions) is obtained with SPA treatment, which promotes carrier transport/extraction and suppresses Shockley-Read-Hall charge recombination in the solar cell. As far as it is known, the reported PCE is so far the highest efficiency in RP phase 2D PSCs based on butylamine (BA) spacers (n = 4). The SPA-processed devices exhibit a satisfactory stability with <4.5% degradation after 2000 h under N(2) environment without encapsulation. The demonstrated process strategy offers a promising route to push forward the performance in 2D PSCs toward realistic photovoltaic applications.},

It is found that the DJ perovskite using TTDMA spacer with extended pi-conjugation length exhibits high film quality, large crystal size and preferred crystal vertical orientation induced by the large crystal nuclei in precursor solution, resulting in lower trap density, reduced exciton binding energy and oriented charge transport. As a result, the optimized 2D DJ perovskite device based on TTDMA (nominal n = 4) delivers a champion PCE up to 18.82%. Importantly, the unencapsulated device based on TTDMA can sustain average 99% of their original efficiency after being stored in N(2) for 4400 h (over 6 months). Moreover, light, thermal, environmental and operational stabilities are also significantly improved in comparison with their 3D counterparts.},

However, although great efforts have been made, no 2D lead iodide perovskites have been discovered as ferroelectrics, in which the ferroelectricity may improve the photovoltaic performance.

The vibrational circular dichroism spectra and crystal structural analysis reveal their homochirality. They both crystalize in a polar space group P1 at room temperature, and undergo a 422F1 type ferroelectric phase transition with transition temperature as high as 483 and 473.2 K, respectively, showing a multiaxial ferroelectric nature. They also possess semiconductor characteristics with a direct bandgap of 2.34 eV. Nevertheless, their racemic analogue adopts a centrosymmetric space group P2(1) /c at room temperature, exhibiting no high-temperature phase transition. The homochirality in 2D lead iodide perovskites facilitates crystallization in polar space groups. This finding indicates an effective way to design high-performance 2D lead iodide perovskite ferroelectrics with great application prospects.},

   abstract = {Quasi-2D layered organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as promising candidates for solar cells, because of their intrinsic stability compared to 3D analogs. However, relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) limits the application of 2D layered perovskites in photovoltaics, due to large energy band gap, high exciton binding energy, and poor interlayer charge transport. Here, efficient and water-stable quasi-2D perovskite solar cells with a peak PCE of 18.20% by using 3-bromobenzylammonium iodide are demonstrated. The unencapsulated devices sustain over 82% of their initial efficiency after 2400 h under relative humidity of approximately 40%, and show almost unchanged photovoltaic parameters after immersion into water for 60 s. The robust performance of perovskite solar cells results from the quasi-2D perovskite films with hydrophobic nature and a high degree of electronic order and high crystallinity, which consists of both ordered large-bandgap perovskites with the vertical growth in the bottom region and oriented small-bandgap components in the top region. Moreover, due to the suppressed nonradiative recombination, the unencapsulated photovoltaic devices can work well as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), exhibiting an external quantum efficiency of 3.85% and a long operational lifetime of approximately 96 h at a high current density of 200 mA cm(-2) in air.},

   abstract = {Compared to efficient green and near-infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs), less progress has been made on deep-blue perovskite LEDs. They suffer from inefficient domain [various number of PbX(6) (-) layers (n)] control, resulting in a series of unfavorable issues such as unstable color, multipeak profile, and poor fluorescence yield. Here, a strategy involving a delicate spacer modulation for quasi-2D perovskite films via an introduction of aromatic polyamine molecules into the perovskite precursor is reported. With low-dimensional component engineering, the n(1) domain, which shows nonradiative recombination and retarded exciton transfer, is significantly suppressed. Also, the n(3) domain, which represents the population of emission species, is remarkably increased. The optimized quasi-2D perovskite film presents blue emission from the n(3) domain (peak at 465 nm) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 77%. It enables the corresponding perovskite LEDs to deliver stable deep-blue emission (CIE (0.145, 0.05)) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.6%. The findings in this work provide further understanding on the structural and emission properties of quasi-2D perovskites, which pave a new route to design deep-blue-emissive perovskite materials.},

   abstract = {Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) afford highly versatile structure design and lattice dimensionalities; thus, they are actively researched as material platforms for the tailoring of ferroic behaviors. Unlike single-phase organic or inorganic materials, the interlayer coupling between organic and inorganic components in HOIPs allows the modification of strain and symmetry by chirality transfer or lattice distortion, thereby enabling the coexistence of ferroic orders. This review focuses on the principles for engineering one or multiple ferroic orders in HOIPs, and the conditions for achieving multiferroicity and magnetoelectric properties. The prospects of multilevel ferroic modulation, chiral spin textures, and spin orbitronics in HOIPs are also presented.},

   abstract = {Chiral organic ligand-incorporated low-dimensional metal-halide perovskites have received increasing attention for next-generation photodetectors because of the direct detection capability of circularly polarized light (CPL), which overcomes the requirement for subsidiary optical components in conventional CPL photodetectors. However, most chiral perovskites have been based on low-dimensional structures that confine chiroptical responses to the ultraviolet (UV) or short-wavelength visible region and limit photocurrent due to their wide bandgap and poor charge transport. Here, chiroptical properties of 3D Cs(0.05) FA(0.5) MA(0.45) Pb(0.5) Sn(0.5) I(3) polycrystalline films are achieved by incorporating chiral plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into the mixed PbSn perovskite, without sacrificing its original optoelectronic properties. CPL detectors fabricated using chiral AuNP-embedded perovskite films can operate without external power input; they exhibit remarkable chirality in the near-infrared (NIR) region with a high anisotropy factor of responsivity (g(res) ) of 0.55, via giant plasmon resonance shift of chiral plasmonic AuNPs. In addition, a CPL detector array fabricated on a plastic substrate demonstrates highly sensitive self-powered NIR detection with superior flexibility and durability.},

   abstract = {The availability of an ever-expanding portfolio of 2D materials with rich internal degrees of freedom (spin, excitonic, valley, sublattice, and layer pseudospin) together with the unique ability to tailor heterostructures made layer by layer in a precisely chosen stacking sequence and relative crystallographic alignments, offers an unprecedented platform for realizing materials by design. However, the breadth of multi-dimensional parameter space and massive data sets involved is emblematic of complex, resource-intensive experimentation, which not only challenges the current state of the art but also renders exhaustive sampling untenable. To this end, machine learning, a very powerful data-driven approach and subset of artificial intelligence, is a potential game-changer, enabling a cheaper - yet more efficient - alternative to traditional computational strategies. It is also a new paradigm for autonomous experimentation for accelerated discovery and machine-assisted design of functional 2D materials and heterostructures. Here, the study reviews the recent progress and challenges of such endeavors, and highlight various emerging opportunities in this frontier research area.},

   abstract = {Traditional trial-and-error experiments and theoretical simulations have difficulty optimizing catalytic processes and developing new, better-performing catalysts. Machine learning (ML) provides a promising approach for accelerating catalysis research due to its powerful learning and predictive abilities. The selection of appropriate input features (descriptors) plays a decisive role in improving the predictive accuracy of ML models and uncovering the key factors that influence catalytic activity and selectivity. This review introduces tactics for the utilization and extraction of catalytic descriptors in ML-assisted experimental and theoretical research. In addition to the effectiveness and advantages of various descriptors, their limitations are also discussed. Highlighted are both 1) newly developed spectral descriptors for catalytic performance prediction and 2) a novel research paradigm combining computational and experimental ML models through suitable intermediate descriptors. Current challenges and future perspectives on the application of descriptors and ML techniques to catalysis are also presented.},

   abstract = {New structural type of 2D AA'(n) (-1) M(n) X(3) (n) (+1) type halide perovskites stabilized by symmetric diammonium cations has attracted research attention recently due to the short interlayer distance and better charge-transport for high-performance solar cells (PSCs). However, the distribution control of quantum wells (QWs) and its influence on optoelectronic properties are largely underexplored. Here effective phase-alignment is reported through dynamical control of film formation to improve charge transfer between quantum wells (QWs) for 2D perovskite (BDA)(MA)(n) (-1) Pb(n) I(3) (n) (+1) (BDA = 1,4-butanediamine, <n> = 4) film. The in situ optical spectra reveal a significantly prolonged crystallization window during the perovskite deposition via additive strategy. It is found that finer thickness gradient by n values in the direction orthogonal to the substrate leads to more efficient charge transport between QWs and suppressed charge recombination in the additive-treated film. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 14.4% is achieved, which is not only 21% higher than the control one without additive treatment, but also one of the high efficiencies of the low-n (n </= 4) AA'(n) (-1) M(n) X(3) (n) (+1) PSCs. Furthermore, the bare device retains 92% of its initial PCE without any encapsulation after ambient exposure for 1200 h.},

   abstract = {Abstract Increasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the two-dimensional (2D) perovskite-based solar cells (PVSCs) is really a challenge. Vertical orientation of the 2D perovskite film is an efficient strategy to elevate the PCE. In this work, vertically orientated highly crystalline 2D (PEA)2(MA)n–1PbnI3n+1 (PEA= phenylethylammonium, MA = methylammonium, n = 3, 4, 5) films are fabricated with the assistance of an ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) additive by a one-step spin-coating method. Planar-structured PVSCs with the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)/(PEA)2(MA)n–1PbnI3n+1/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester/bahocuproine/Ag are fabricated. The PCE of the PVSCs is boosted from the original 0.56% (without NH4SCN) to 11.01% with the optimized NH4SCN addition at n = 5, which is among the highest PCE values for the low-n (n < 10) 2D perovskite-based PVSCs. The improved performance is attributed to the vertically orientated highly crystalline 2D perovskite thin films as well as the balanced electron/hole transportation. The humidity stability of this oriented 2D perovskite thin film is also confirmed by the almost unchanged X-ray diffraction patterns after 28 d exposed to the moisture in a humidity-controlled cabinet (Hr = 55 ± 5%). The unsealed device retains 78.5% of its original PCE after 160 h storage in air atmosphere with humidity of 55 ± 5%. The results provide an effective approach toward a highly efficient and stable PVSC for future commercialization.},

   abstract = {Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) with crystallographically 2D structures have gained increasing interest for photovoltaic applications due to their superior chemical stability and intriguing anisotropic properties, which are in contrast to their conventional 3D perovskite counterparts. The most frequently studied LHPs are Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases, which suffer from a carrier-transport bottleneck due to the van der Waals gap associated with their intrinsic organic interlayer structures. To address this issue, Dion-Jacobson (DJ) and alternating-cation-interlayer (ACI) LHPs have rapidly emerged, which exhibit unique structural and (opto)electronic characteristics that may resemble those of the 3D counterparts owing to the eliminated or reduced van der Waals gap. Improved photophysical properties have been achieved in DJ and ACI LHPs, leading towards better photovoltaic performance. Here we provide a comprehensive discussion on the merits and promises of DJ and ACI LHPs from a chemistry perspective. Then, we review recent progress on the synthesis and tailoring of DJ and ACI LHP crystals and thin films, as well as their optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Finally, we discuss possible pathways to overcome critical challenges to realize the full potential of DJ and ACI LHPs for high-performance solar cells and beyond.},

   abstract = {Exciton delocalization in organic semiconducting polymers, affected by structures at a molecular level, plays a crucial role in modulating relaxation pathways, such as charge generation and singlet fission, which can boost device efficiency. However, the structural diversity of polymers and broad signals from typical electronic spectroscopy have their limits when it comes to revealing the interplay between local structures and exciton delocalization. To tackle these problems, we apply femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy in archetypical conjugated oligothiophenes with different chain lengths. We observed Raman frequency dispersions of symmetric bond stretching modes and mode-specific kinetics in the S(1) Raman spectra, which underpins the subtle and complex interplay between exciton delocalization and bond length alternation along the conjugation coordinate. Our results provide a more general picture of exciton delocalization in the context of molecular structures for conjugated materials.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are an attractive class of hybrid perovskites that have additional optoelectronic tunability due to their accommodation of relatively large organic ligands. Nevertheless, contemporary ligand design depends on either expensive trial-and-error testing of whether a ligand can be integrated within the lattice or conservative heuristics that unduly limit the scope of ligand chemistries. Here, the structural determinants of stable ligand incorporation within Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase perovskites are established by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of over ten-thousand RP-phase perovskites and training of machine learning classifiers capable of predicting structural stability based solely on generalizable ligand features. The simulation results show near-perfect predictions of positive and negative literature examples, predict trade-offs between several ligand features and stability, and ultimately predict an inexhaustibly large 2D-compatible ligand design-space.},

Our first-generation devices containing (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] (1; PEA=C6H5(CH2)2NH3(+), MA=CH3NH3(+)) show an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V and a power conversion efficiency of 4.73%. The layered structure allows for high-quality films to be deposited through spin coating and high-temperature annealing is not required for device fabrication. The 3D perovskite (MA)[PbI3] (2) has recently been identified as a promising absorber for solar cells. However, its instability to moisture requires anhydrous processing and operating conditions. Films of 1 are more moisture resistant than films of 2 and devices containing 1 can be fabricated under ambient humidity levels. The larger bandgap of the 2D structure is also suitable as the higher bandgap absorber in a dual-absorber tandem device. Compared to 2, the layered perovskite structure may offer greater tunability at the molecular level for material optimization.},

   abstract = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising candidate for the next-generation photovoltaic technologies. As an essential element for high-efficiency PSCs however, the heavy metal Pb is soluble in water, causing a serious threat to the environment and human health. Due to the weak ionic bonding in three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, drastic structure decomposition occurs when immersing the perovskite film in water, which accelerates the Pb leakage. By introducing the chemically stable Dion-Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite at the 3D perovskite surface, the film dissolution is significantly slowed down, which retards lead leakage. As a result, the Pb contamination is dramatically reduced under various extreme conditions. In addition, the PSCs device deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.6 % and retain over 95 % of their initial PCE after the maximum power point tracking for over 1100 h.},

   abstract = {Layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are emerging as promising optoelectronic materials owing to their excellent environmental stability. Regulating the dipole moment of organic spacers has the potential to reduce the exciton binding energy (E(b) ) of 2D perovskites and improve their photovoltaic performance. Here, we developed two azetidine-based secondary ammonium spacers with different electron-withdrawing groups, namely 3-hydroxyazatidine (3-OHAz) and 3,3-difluoroazetidine (3,3-DFAz) spacers, for 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites. It was found that the large dipole moment of the fluorinated dipole spacer could effectively enhance the interaction between organic spacers and inorganic layers, leading to improved charge dissociation in 2D RP perovskite. In contrast to 3-OHAz spacer, the 2D perovskite using 3,3-DFAz as spacer also shows improved film quality, optimized energy level alignment, and reduced exciton binding energy. As a result, the 2D perovskite (n=4) device based on 3,3-DFAz yields an outstanding efficiency of 19.28 %, surpassing that of the 3-OHAz-Pb device (PCE=11.35 %). The efficiency was further improved to 19.85 % when using mixed A-site cation of MA(0.95) FA(0.05) . This work provides an effective strategy for modulating the energy level alignment and reducing the E(b) by regulating the dipole moment of organic spacers, ultimately enabling the development of high-performance 2D perovskite solar cells.},

   abstract = {The discovery of new crystalline inorganic compounds-novel compositions of matter within known structure types, or even compounds with completely new crystal structures-constitutes an important goal of solid-state and materials chemistry. Some fractions of new compounds can eventually lead to new structural and functional materials that enhance the efficiency of existing technologies or even enable completely new technologies. Materials researchers eagerly welcome new approaches to the discovery of new compounds, especially those that offer the promise of accelerated success. The recent report from a group of scientists at Google who employ a combination of existing data sets, high-throughput density functional theory calculations of structural stability, and the tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to propose new compounds is an exciting advance. We examine the claims of this work here, unfortunately finding scant evidence for compounds that fulfill the trifecta of novelty, credibility, and utility. While the methods adopted in this work appear to hold promise, there is clearly a great need to incorporate domain expertise in materials synthesis and crystallography.},

   abstract = {Hybrid halide perovskites are now superstar materials leading the field of low-cost thin film photovoltaics technologies. Following the surge for more efficient and stable 3D bulk alloys, multilayered halide perovskites and colloidal perovskite nanostructures appeared in 2016 as viable alternative solutions to this challenge, largely exceeding the original proof of concept made in 2009 and 2014, respectively. This triggered renewed interest in lower-dimensional hybrid halide perovskites and at the same time increasingly more numerous and differentiated applications. The present paper is a review of the past and present literature on both colloidal nanostructures and multilayered compounds, emphasizing that availability of accurate structural information is of dramatic importance to reach a fair understanding of quantum and dielectric confinement effects. Layered halide perovskites occupy a special place in the history of halide perovskites, with a large number of seminal papers in the 1980s and 1990s. In recent years, the rationalization of structure-properties relationship has greatly benefited from new theoretical approaches dedicated to their electronic structures and optoelectronic properties, as well as a growing number of contributions based on modern experimental techniques. This is a necessary step to provide in-depth tools to decipher their extensive chemical engineering possibilities which surpass the ones of their 3D bulk counterparts. Comparisons to classical semiconductor nanostructures and 2D van der Waals heterostructures are also stressed. Since 2015, colloidal nanostructures have undergone a quick development for applications based on light emission. Although intensively studied in the last two years by various spectroscopy techniques, the description of quantum and dielectric confinement effects on their optoelectronic properties is still in its infancy.},

   abstract = {With rapid progress in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) to reach 25%, metal halide perovskite-based solar cells became a game-changer in a photovoltaic performance race.

The high efficiency in combination with the low cost of materials and processes are the selling points of this cell over commercial silicon or other organic and inorganic solar cells. The characteristic features of perovskite materials may enable further advancement of the PCE beyond those afforded by the silicon solar cells, toward the Shockley-Queisser limit. This review summarizes the fundamentals behind the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials, as well as the important approaches to fabricating high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, possible next-generation strategies for enhancing the PCE over the Shockley-Queisser limit are discussed.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have emerged as outstanding semiconducting materials thanks to their superior stability and structural diversity. However, the ever-growing field of optoelectronic device research using 2D perovskites requires systematic understanding of the effects of the spacer on the structure, properties, and device performance. So far, many studies are based on trial-and-error tests of random spacers with limited ability to predict the resulting structure of these synthetic experiments, hindering the discovery of novel 2D materials to be incorporated into high-performance devices. In this review, we provide guidelines on successfully choosing spacers and incorporating them into crystalline materials and optoelectronic devices. We first provide a summary of various synthetic methods to act as a tutorial for groups interested in pursuing synthesis of novel 2D perovskites. Second, we provide our insights on what kind of spacer cations can stabilize 2D perovskites followed by an extensive review of the spacer cations, which have been shown to stabilize 2D perovskites with an emphasis on the effects of the spacer on the structure and optical properties. Next, we provide a similar explanation for the methods used to fabricate films and their desired properties. Like the synthesis section, we will then focus on various spacers that have been used in devices and how they influence the film structure and device performance. With a comprehensive understanding of these effects, a rational selection of novel spacers can be made, accelerating this already exciting field.},

However, it is not clear whether moire excitons and flat bands can be formed in such heterostructures. Here, we predict from first principles that twisted homobilayers of RP perovskite, MA2PbI4, can host moire excitons and yield flat energy bands. The moire excitons exhibit unique and hybridized characteristics with electrons confined in a single layer of a striped distribution while holes localized in both layers. Nearly flat valence bands can be formed in the bilayers with relatively large twist angles, thanks to the presence of hydrogen bonds that strengthen the interlayer coupling. External pressures can further increase the interlayer coupling, yielding more localized moire excitons and flatter valence bands. Finally, electrostatic gating is predicted to tune the degree of hybridization, energy, position and localization of moire excitons in twisted MA2PbI4 bilayers.},

Taking as input computed or experimental materials data, ML algorithms predict the structural, electronic, mechanical, and chemical properties of 2D materials that have yet to be discovered. Such predictions expand investigations on how to synthesize 2D materials and use them in various applications, as well as greatly reduce the time and cost to discover and understand 2D materials. This tutorial review focuses on the understanding, discovery, and synthesis of 2D materials enabled by or benefiting from various ML techniques. We introduce the most recent efforts to adopt ML in various fields of study regarding 2D materials and provide an outlook for future research opportunities.

   abstract = {Over the last several years, there has been tremendous progress in the development of nanoscale halide perovskite materials and devices that possess a wide range of band gaps and tunable optical and electronic properties. Particularly, the emerging two-dimensional (2D) forms of halide perovskites are attracting more interest due to the long charge carrier lifetime, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, and great defect tolerance. Interfacing 2D halide perovskites with other 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly broadens the application range of the 2D materials and enhances the performance of the functional devices. The synthesis and characterization of 2D halide perovskite nanostructures, the interface of the 2D halide perovskites with other 2D materials, and the integration of them into high-performance optoelectronic devices including solar cells, photodetectors, transistors, and memory devices are currently under investigation. In this article, we review the progress of the above-mentioned topics in a timely manner and discuss the current challenges and future promising directions in this field.},

   abstract = {The nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS)-XY-Scan is a simple and easy tool for the quantitative measurement of the aromaticity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and identification of the existence of local and global ring currents. We recently introduced an additivity scheme that uses the NICS-XY-Scans of smaller building blocks to predict the aromatic profiles of larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon systems. We now report on an expansion of the methodology to include systems of varying aromatic natures containing the heteroatoms B, N, O, and S. The additivity approach allows for rapid and resource-efficient generation of NICS-XY-Scans of large, complex systems. Moreover, it reveals that the magnetic criterion of aromaticity behaves in an additive manner, and that the ring currents of multi-ring systems appear to be mostly localized within subunits of up to three rings.},

   abstract = {Dynamic crystalline materials have emerged as a unique category of condensed phase matter that combines crystalline lattice with components that display dynamic behavior in the solid state. This has involved a range of materials incorporating dynamic functional units in the form of stimuli-responsive molecular switches and machines, among others. In particular, it has been possible by relying on framework materials, such as porous molecular frameworks and other hybrid organic-inorganic systems that demonstrated potential for serving as scaffolds for dynamic molecular functions. As functional dynamics increase the level of complexity, the associated phenomena are often overlooked and need to be explored. In this perspective, we discuss a selection of recent developments of dynamic solid-state materials across material classes, outlining opportunities and fundamental and methodological challenges for their advancement toward innovative functionality and applications.},

   abstract = {Four inorganic-organic hybrid materials that consist of 2-D layers of corner-sharing lead(II) iodide octahedra separated by alkylammonium chains have been crystallized and characterized via single-crystal XRD (SCXRD). The four hybrids, represented by the general formula [(C(n)H(2n+1)NH(3))(2)PbI(4)] and abbreviated C(n)PbI, exhibit multiple reversible phase transitions for a narrow temperature range. The transition temperatures were determined with differential scanning calorimetry experiments. The number of transitions and the transition temperatures are dependant on the chain length; for n = 7 and 10, there are three transitions, and for n = 8 and 9, there are two transitions. Regardless of the number of transitions, all four compounds have identical lowest temperature phases, which have inorganic layers that are eclipsed, non-planar conformations of the alkyl ammonium chains and yellow-coloured crystals. The next highest temperature phase for three of the compounds (C(10)PbI goes through an intermediate phase first), has staggered inorganic layers, all-trans planar conformations of the chains and orange coloured crystals. The highest temperature phase for n = 8 and 10 has red-coloured crystals and shows a disordering of the alkylammonium chains over two positions and staggered inorganic layers. The high temperature phase of C(7)PbI retains its orange colour and has only increased thermal motion of its alkylammonium chain. The structure of the high temperature phase of C(9)PbI was not determined. The SCXRD structures of the various phases give clues to the structural changes that the compounds undergo at the phase transitions, which will now enable future studies of their optical and electronic properties to be better understood.},

   abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) coupled with promising machine learning (ML) techniques well known from computer science is broadly affecting many aspects of various fields including science and technology, industry, and even our day-to-day life. The ML techniques have been developed to analyze high-throughput data with a view to obtaining useful insights, categorizing, predicting, and making evidence-based decisions in novel ways, which will promote the growth of novel applications and fuel the sustainable booming of AI. This paper undertakes a comprehensive survey on the development and application of AI in different aspects of fundamental sciences, including information science, mathematics, medical science, materials science, geoscience, life science, physics, and chemistry. The challenges that each discipline of science meets, and the potentials of AI techniques to handle these challenges, are discussed in detail. Moreover, we shed light on new research trends entailing the integration of AI into each scientific discipline. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad research guideline on fundamental sciences with potential infusion of AI, to help motivate researchers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art applications of AI-based fundamental sciences, and thereby to help promote the continuous development of these fundamental sciences.},

   abstract = {Organic crystal structures exert a profound impact on the physicochemical properties and biological effects of organic compounds. Quantum mechanics (QM)-based crystal structure predictions (CSPs) have somewhat alleviated the dilemma that experimental crystal structure investigations struggle to conduct complete polymorphism studies, but the high computing cost poses a challenge to its widespread application. The present study aims to construct DeepCSP, a feasible pure machine learning framework for minute-scale rapid organic CSP. Initially, based on 177,746 data entries from the Cambridge Crystal Structure Database, a generative adversarial network was built to conditionally generate trial crystal structures under selected feature constraints for the given molecule. Simultaneously, a graph convolutional attention network was used to predict the density of stable crystal structures for the input molecule. Subsequently, the distances between the predicted density and the definition-based calculated density would be considered to be the crystal structure screening and ranking basis, and finally, the density-based crystal structure ranking would be output. Two such distinct algorithms, performing the generation and ranking functionalities, respectively, collectively constitute the DeepCSP, which has demonstrated compelling performance in marketed drug validations, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 80% and a hit rate surpassing 85%. Inspiringly, the computing speed of the pure machine learning methodology demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in advancing CSP research.},

   abstract = {A series of two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (HOIP) crystals, based on acene alkylamine cations (i.e., phenylmethylammonium (PMA), 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA), 1-(2-naphthyl)methanammonium (NMA), and 2-(2-naphthyl)ethanammonium (NEA)) and lead(II) halide (i.e., PbX4(2-), X = Cl, Br, and I) frameworks, and their corresponding thin films were fabricated and examined for structure-property relationship. Several new or redetermined crystal structures are reported, including those for (NEA)2PbI4, (NEA)2PbBr4, (NMA)2PbBr4, (PMA)2PbBr4, and (PEA)2PbI4. Non-centrosymmetric structures from among these 2D HOIPs were confirmed by piezoresponse force microscopy-especially noteworthy is the structure of (PMA)2PbBr4, which was previously reported as centrosymmetric. Examination of the impact of organic cation and inorganic layer choice on the exciton absorption/emission properties, among the set of compounds considered, reveals that perovskite layer distortion (i.e., Pb-I-Pb bond angle between adjacent PbI6 octahedra) has a more global effect on the exciton properties than octahedral distortion (i.e., variation of I-Pb-I bond angles and discrepancy among Pb-I bond lengths within each PbI6 octahedron). In addition to the characteristic sharp exciton emission for each perovskite, (PMA)2PbCl4, (PEA)2PbCl4, (NMA)2PbCl4, and (PMA)2PbBr4 exhibit separate, broad "white" emission in the long wavelength range. Piezoelectric compounds identified from these 2D HOIPs may be considered for future piezoresponse-type energy or electronic applications.},

   abstract = {A broad organic-inorganic series of hybrid metal iodide perovskites with the general formulation AMI3, where A is the methylammonium (CH3NH3(+)) or formamidinium (HC(NH2)2(+)) cation and M is Sn (1 and 2) or Pb (3 and 4) are reported. The compounds have been prepared through a variety of synthetic approaches, and the nature of the resulting materials is discussed in terms of their thermal stability and optical and electronic properties. We find that the chemical and physical properties of these materials strongly depend on the preparation method. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 1-4 classifies the compounds in the perovskite structural family. Structural phase transitions were observed and investigated by temperature-dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction in the 100-400 K range. The charge transport properties of the materials are discussed in conjunction with diffuse reflectance studies in the mid-IR region that display characteristic absorption features. Temperature-dependent studies show a strong dependence of the resistivity as a function of the crystal structure. Optical absorption measurements indicate that 1-4 behave as direct-gap semiconductors with energy band gaps distributed in the range of 1.25-1.75 eV. The compounds exhibit an intense near-IR photoluminescence (PL) emission in the 700-1000 nm range (1.1-1.7 eV) at room temperature. We show that solid solutions between the Sn and Pb compounds are readily accessible throughout the composition range. The optical properties such as energy band gap, emission intensity, and wavelength can be readily controlled as we show for the isostructural series of solid solutions CH3NH3Sn(1-x)Pb(x)I3 (5). The charge transport type in these materials was characterized by Seebeck coefficient and Hall-effect measurements. The compounds behave as p- or n-type semiconductors depending on the preparation method. The samples with the lowest carrier concentration are prepared from solution and are n-type; p-type samples can be obtained through solid state reactions exposed in air in a controllable manner. In the case of Sn compounds, there is a facile tendency toward oxidation which causes the materials to be doped with Sn(4+) and thus behave as p-type semiconductors displaying metal-like conductivity. The compounds appear to possess very high estimated electron and hole mobilities that exceed 2000 cm(2)/(V s) and 300 cm(2)/(V s), respectively, as shown in the case of CH3NH3SnI3 (1). We also compare the properties of the title hybrid materials with those of the "all-inorganic" CsSnI3 and CsPbI3 prepared using identical synthetic methods.},

   abstract = {The effect of chemical-composition modification on the chiroptical property of chiral organic ammonium cation-containing organic inorganic hybrid perovskite (chiral OIHP) is investigated. Varying the mixing ratio of bromide and iodide anions in S- or R-C(6)H(5)CH(2)(CH(3))NH(3))(2)PbI(4(1-x))Br(4x) modifies the band gap of chiral OIHP, leading to a shift of the circular dichroism (CD) signal from 495 to 474 nm. However, it is also found that an abrupt crystalline structure transition occurs, and the CD signal is turned off when iodide-determinant phases are transformed into the bromide-determinant phase. To obtain CD in the wavelength range where the bromide-determinant phase is supposed to exhibit chiroptical activity, that is, <474 nm, S- or R-C(12)H(7)CH(2)(CH(3))NH(3) with a larger spacer group can be adopted; thus, the CD signal can be further blue-shifted to approximately 375 nm. Here, we show that chemical-composition modification of chiral OIHP affects the chiroptical properties of chiral OIHP in two ways: (1) tuning the wavelength of CD by modulating the excitonic band structure and (2) switching the CD on and off by inducing a crystalline-structure change. These properties can be utilized for structural engineering of high-performance chiroptical materials for spin-polarized light-emitting devices and polarization-based optoelectronics.},

   abstract = {We report on the fabrication and properties of the semiconducting 2D (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) perovskite thin films. The band gaps of the series decrease with increasing n values, from 2.24 eV (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2PbI4 (n = 1) to 1.52 eV CH3NH3PbI3 (n = infinity). The compounds exhibit strong light absorption in the visible region, accompanied by strong photoluminescence at room temperature, rendering them promising light absorbers for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, we find that thin films of the semi-2D perovskites display an ultrahigh surface coverage as a result of the unusual film self-assembly that orients the [Pb(n)I(3n+1)](-) layers perpendicular to the substrates. We have successfully implemented this 2D perovskite family in solid-state solar cells, and obtained an initial power conversion efficiency of 4.02%, featuring an open-circuit voltage (V(oc)) of 929 mV and a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 9.42 mA/cm(2) from the n = 3 compound. This result is even more encouraging considering that the device retains its performance after long exposure to a high-humidity environment. Overall, the homologous 2D halide perovskites define a promising class of stable and efficient light-absorbing materials for solid-state photovoltaics and other applications.},

These layered hybrids emit radiation across the entire visible spectrum upon ultraviolet excitation. They are promising as single-source white-light phosphors for use with ultraviolet light-emitting diodes in solid-state lighting devices. The broadband emission provides high color rendition and the chromaticity coordinates of the emission can be tuned through halide substitution. We have isolated materials that emit the "warm" white light sought for many indoor lighting applications as well as "cold" white light that approximates the visible region of the solar spectrum. Material syntheses are inexpensive and scalable and binding agents are not required for film deposition, eliminating problems of binder photodegradation. These well-defined and tunable structures provide a flexible platform for studying the rare phenomenon of intrinsic broadband emission from bulk materials.},

Upon near-ultraviolet excitation, two new Pb-Cl and Pb-Br perovskites emit broadband "cold" and "warm" white light, respectively, with high color rendition. Emission from large, single crystals indicates an origin from the bulk material and not surface defect sites. The Pb-Br perovskite has a PLQE of 9%, which is undiminished after 3 months of continuous irradiation. Our mechanistic studies indicate that the emission has contributions from strong electron-phonon coupling in a deformable lattice and from a distribution of intrinsic trap states.

   abstract = {The Goldschmidt tolerance factor in halide perovskites limits the number of cations that can enter their cages without destabilizing their overall structure. Here, we have explored the limits of this geometric factor and found that the ethylammonium (EA) cations which lie outside the tolerance factor range can still enter the cages of the 2D halide perovskites by stretching them. The new perovskites allow us to study how these large cations occupying the perovskite cages affect the structural, optical, and electronic properties. We report a series of cation engineered 2D Ruddlesden-Popper lead iodide perovskites (BA)(2)(EA(x)MA(1-x))(2)Pb(3)I(10) (x = 0-1, BA is n-butylammonium, MA is methylammonium) by the incorporation of a large EA cation in the cage. An analysis of the single-crystal structures reveals that the incorporation of EA in the cage significantly stretches Pb-I bonds, expands the cage, and induces a larger octahedral distortion in the inorganic framework. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies show that such structural deformation leads to a blue-shifted bandgap, sub-bandgap trap states with wider energetic distribution, and stronger photoluminescence quenching. These results enrich the family of 2D perovskites and provide new insights for understanding the structure-property relationship in perovskite materials.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have several distinct structural classes and exhibit great tunability, stability, and high potential for photovoltaic applications. Here, we report a new series of hybrid 2D perovskites in the Dion-Jacobson (DJ) class based on aromatic m-phenylenediammonium (mPDA) dications. The crystal structures of the DJ perovskite materials (mPDA)MA(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 1-3) were solved and refined using single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The results indicate a short I...I interlayer distance of 4.00-4.04 A for the (mPDA)MA(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 2 and 3) structures, which is the shortest among DJ perovskites. However, Pb-I-Pb angles are as small as 158-160 degrees , reflecting the large distortion of the inorganic framework, which results in larger band gaps for these materials than those in other DJ analogues. Density functional theory calculations suggest appreciable dispersion in the stacking direction, unlike the band structures of the Ruddlesden-Popper phases, which exhibit flat bands along the stacking direction. This is a consequence of the short interlayer I...I distances that can lead to interlayer electronic coupling across the layers. The solution-deposited films (nominal (mPDA)MA(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) compositions of n = 1-6) reveal improved surface coverage with increasing nominal n value with the higher n films being composed of a mixture of n = 1 and bulk three-dimensional MAPbI(3) perovskites. The films made from solutions of these materials behave differently from those of other 2D iodide perovskites, and their solar cells have a mixture of n = 1 DJ and MAPbI(3) as light-absorbing semiconductors.},

The RP structures show a blue-shift in bandgap for decreasing n (1.90 eV for n = 4 and 2.03 eV for n = 3), while the SL structures have an even greater blue-shift (2.53 eV for m = 4, 2.74 eV for m = 3, and 2.93 eV for m = 2). DFT calculations show that, while the RP structures are electronically 2D quantum wells, the SL structures are electronically 1D quantum wires with chains of corner-sharing octahedra "insulated" by blocks of face-sharing octahedra. Dark measurements for RP crystals show high resistivity perpendicular to the layers (10(11) Omega cm) but a lower resistivity parallel to them (10(7) Omega cm). The SL crystals have varying resistivity in all three directions, confirming both RP and SL crystals' utility as anisotropic electronic materials. The RP structures show strong photoresponse, whereas the SL materials exhibit resistivity trends that are dominated by ionic transport and no photoresponse.

The sign of the zero-bias photocurrent is altered by the R/S-chirality of the assembled cations, which define the direction of electric polarization derived from the electric dipole moment of each chiral organic cation aligned in a crystal. The strategy of chirality control in a crystal is expected to be useful when searching for BPVE materials.},

   abstract = {Predicting the synthesizability of inorganic materials is one of the major challenges in accelerated material discovery. A widely employed approximate approach is to consider the thermodynamic decomposition stability due to its simplicity of computing, but it is notorious for either producing too many candidates or missing important metastable materials. These results, however, are not unexcepted since the synthesizability is a complex phenomenon, and the thermodynamic stability is just one contributor. Here, we suggest a machine-learning model to quantify the probability of synthesis based on the partially supervised learning of materials database. We adapted the positive and unlabeled machine learning (PU learning) by implementing the graph convolutional neural network as a classifier in which the model outputs crystal-likeness scores (CLscore). The model shows 87.4% true positive (CLscore > 0.5) prediction accuracy for the test set of experimentally reported cases (9356 materials) in the Materials Project. We further validated the model by predicting the synthesizability of newly reported experimental materials in the last 5 years (2015-2019) with an 86.2% true positive rate using the model trained with the database as of the end of year 2014. Our analysis shows that our model captures the structural motif for synthesizability beyond what is possible by E(hull). We find that 71 materials among the top 100 high-scoring virtual materials have indeed been previously synthesized in the literature. With the proposed data-driven metric of the crystal-likeness score, high-throughput virtual screenings and generative models can benefit significantly by effectively reducing the chemical space that needs to be explored experimentally in the future toward more rational materials design.},

The use of the 2D perovskite (ThMA)(2)(MA) (n-1)Pb (n)I(3 n+1) ( n = 3) in deposited highly oriented thin films from N, N-dimethylformamide using a methylammonium chloride (MACl) assisted film-forming technique dramatically improves the efficiency of 2D perovskite photovoltaic devices from 1.74% to over 15%, which is the highest efficiency for 2D perovskite ( n < 6) solar cells so far. The enhanced performance of the 2D perovskite devices using MACl as additive is ascribed to the growth of a dense web of nanorod-like film with near-single-crystalline quality, in which the crystallographic planes of the 2D MA (n-1)Pb (n)I(3 n+1)(2-) slabs preferentially aligned perpendicular to the substrate, thus facilitating efficient charge transport. This work provides a new insight into exploration of the formation mechanism of 2D perovskites with increased crystallinity and crystal orientation suitable for high-performance solar cells.},

   abstract = {Organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskites are promising semiconductors with tailorable optical and electronic properties. The choice of A-site cation to support a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structure AMX(3) (where M is a metal and X is a halide) is limited by the geometric Goldschmidt tolerance factor. However, this geometric constraint can be relaxed in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, providing us an opportunity to understand how various A-site cations modulate the structural properties and thereby the optoelectronic properties. Here, we report the synthesis and structures of single-crystal (BA)(2)(A)Pb(2)I(7) where BA = butylammonium and A = methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), dimethylammonium (DMA), or guanidinium (GA), with a series of A-site cations varying in size. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that the MA, FA, and GA structures crystallize in the same Cmcm space group, while the DMA imposes the Ccmb space group. We observe that as the A-site cation becomes larger, the Pb-I bond continuously elongates, expanding the volume of the perovskite cage, equivalent to exerting "negative pressure" on the perovskite structures. Optical studies and DFT calculations show that the Pb-I bond length elongation reduces the overlap of the Pb s- and I p-orbitals and increases the optical bandgap, while Pb-I-Pb tilting angles play a secondary role. Raman spectra show lattice softening with increasing size of the A-site cation. These structural changes with enlarged A cations result in significant decreases in photoluminescence intensity and lifetime, consistent with a more pronounced nonradiative decay. Transient absorption microscopy results suggest that the PL drop may derive from a higher concentration of traps or phonon-assisted nonradiative recombination. The results highlight that extending the range of Goldschmidt tolerance factors for 2D perovskites is achievable, enabling further tuning of the structure-property relationships in 2D perovskites.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have extraordinary optoelectronic properties and structural tunability. Among them, the Dion-Jacobson phases with the inorganic layers stacking exactly on top of each other are less explored. Herein, we present the new series of 2D Dion-Jacobson halide perovskites, which adopt the general formula of A'A(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (A' = 4-(aminomethyl)pyridinium (4AMPY), A = methylammonium (MA), n = 1-4). By modifying the position of the CH(2)NH(3)(+) group from 4AMPY to 3AMPY (3AMPY = 3-(aminomethyl)pyridinium), the stacking of the inorganic layers changes from exactly eclipsed to slightly offset. The perovskite octahedra tilts are also different between the two series, with the 3AMPY series exhibiting smaller bandgaps than the 4AMPY series. Compared to the aliphatic cation of the same size (AMP = (aminomethyl)piperidinium), the aromatic spacers increase the rigidity of the cation, reduce the interlayer spacing, and decrease the dielectric mismatch between inorganic layer and the organic spacer, showing the indirect but powerful influence of the organic cations on the structure and consequently on the optical properties of the perovskite materials. All A'A(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) compounds exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. Preliminary solar cell devices based on the n = 4 perovskites as absorbers of both series exhibit promising performances, with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.20% for (3AMPY)(MA)(3)Pb(4)I(13)-based devices, which is higher than the (4AMPY)(MA)(3)Pb(4)I(13) and the corresponding aliphatic analogue (3AMP)(MA)(3)Pb(4)I(13)-based ones.},

   abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) halide perovskites have attracted enormous research interest, but the choice of the A-site cations is limited by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. In order to accommodate cations that lie outside the acceptable range of the tolerance factor, low-dimensional structures usually form. To maintain the favorable 3D connection, the links among the metal-halide octahedra need to be rearranged to fit the large cations. This can result in a departure from the proper corner-sharing perovskite architectures and lead to distinctly different perovskitoid motifs with edge- and face-sharing. In this work, we report four new 3D bromide perovskitoids incorporating linear organic diammonium cations, A'Pb(2)Br(6) (A' is a +2 cation). We propose a rule that can guide the further expansion of this class of compounds, analogous to the notion of Goldschmidt tolerance factor widely adopted for 3D AMX(3) perovskites. The fundamental building blocks in A'Pb(2)Br(6) consist of two edge-shared octahedra, which are then connected by corner-sharing to form a 3D network. Different compounds adopt different structural motifs, which can be transformed from one to another by symmetry operations. Electronic structure calculations suggest that they are direct bandgap semiconductors, with relatively large band dispersions created by octahedra connected by corner-sharing. They exhibit similar electronic band structures and dynamic lattice characteristics to the regular 3D AMX(3) perovskites. Structures with smaller Pb-Br-Pb angles and larger octahedra distortion exhibit broad photoluminescence at room temperature. The emerging structure-property relationships in these 3D perovskitoids set the foundation for designing and investigating these compounds for a variety of optoelectronic applications.},

   abstract = {Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection has sparked overwhelming research interest for its widespread chiroptoelectronic and spintronic applications. Ferroelectric materials, especially emerging layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics, exhibiting striking bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) present significant possibilities for CPL detection by a distinctive working concept. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the realization of robust angular anisotropy of CPL detection in a new layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric crystal (CPA)(2)FAPb(2)Br(7) (1, CPA is chloropropylammonium, FA is formamidinium), which crystallized in an optically active achiral polar point group. Benefiting from the notable spontaneous polarization (5.1 muC/cm(2)) and excellent semiconducting characteristics, single crystals of 1 exhibit remarkable BPVE under light illumination, with a high current on/off switching ratio (ca. 10(3)). More intriguingly, driven by the angular carrier drift originating from spin-dependent BPVE in optically active ferroelectrics, 1 displays highly sensitive self-powered CPL detection performance, showing a robust angular anisotropy factor up to 0.98, which is far more than those achieved by material intrinsic chirality. This work provides an unprecedented approach for realizing highly sensitive CPL detection, which sheds light on the further design of optically active ferroelectrics for chiral photonic applications.},

   abstract = {Controlling grain growth is of great importance in maximizing the charge carrier transport for polycrystalline thin-film electronic devices. The thin-film growth of halide perovskite materials has been manipulated via a number of approaches including solvent engineering, composition engineering, and post-treatment processes. However, none of these methods lead to large-scale atomically flat thin films with extremely large grain size and high charge carrier mobility. Here, we demonstrate a novel pi-conjugated ligand design approach for controlling the thin-film nucleation and growth kinetics in two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites. By extending the pi-conjugation and increasing the planarity of the semiconducting ligand, nucleation density can be decreased by more than 5 orders of magnitude. As a result, wafer-scale 2D perovskite thin films with highly ordered crystalline structures and extremely large grain size are readily obtained. We demonstrate high-performance field-effect transistors with hole mobility approaching 10 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) with ON/OFF current ratios of approximately 10(6) and excellent stability and reproducibility. Our modeling analysis further confirms the origin of enhanced charge transport and field and temperature dependence of the observed mobility, which allows for clear deciphering of the structure-property relationships in these nascent 2D semiconductor systems.},

   abstract = {Dion-Jacobson (DJ) phase 2D perovskites with various aromatic diammonium cations, potentially possessing high stability, have been developed for optoelectronics. However, their stability does not meet initial expectations, and some of them even easily degrade into lower-dimensional structures. Underlying the stability mechanism and dimensional reduction of these DJ 2D perovskites remains elusive. Herein, we report that pi-pi stacking intensity between aromatic cations determines structural stability and dimensional variation of DJ 2D perovskites by investigating nine benzene diammoniums (BDAs)-derived low-dimensional perovskites. The BDAs without intermolecular pi-pi stacking form stable DJ 2D perovskites, while those showing strong pi-pi stacking tend to generate 1D and 0D architectures. Furthermore, the pi-pi stacking intensity highly relies on molecular symmetry and electrostatic potential of BDAs; namely, asymmetry and small dipole moment facilitate alleviating the pi-pi stacking, leading to the formation of DJ 2D perovskites and vice versa. Our findings establish the relationship of aromatic diammonium structure-pi-pi stacking interaction-perovskite dimensionality, which can guide the design of stable DJ 2D perovskites and the manipulation of perovskite dimensionality for various optoelectronic applications.},

In this work, we report a new type of DJ phase CsPb(Br/Cl)(3) perovskite via introduction of an asymmetric molecular configuration as the organic spacer cation in perovskites. The primary and tertiary ammonium groups on the asymmetric cations bridge with the lead halide octahedra forming the DJ phase structures. Stable photoluminescence spectra were demonstrated in perovskite films owing to the suppressed halide segregation. Meanwhile, the radiative recombination efficiency of charges is improved significantly as a result of the confinement effects and passivation of charge traps. Finally, we achieved an external quantum efficiency of 2.65% in blue PeLEDs with stable spectra emission under applied bias voltages. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of asymmetric cations used in PeLEDs, which provides a facile solution to the halide segregation issue in PeLEDs.},

   abstract = {Low-dimensional organic-inorganic halide perovskites have attracted interest for their properties in exciton dynamics, broad-band emission, magnetic spin selectivity. However, there is no quantitative model for predicting the structure-directing effect of organic cations on the dimensionality of these low-dimensional perovskites. Here, we report a machine learning (ML)-assisted approach to predict the dimensionality of lead iodide-based perovskites. A literature review reveals 86 reported amines that are classified into "2D"-forming and "non-2D"-forming based on the dimensionality of their perovskites. Machining learning models were trained and tested based on the classification and descriptor features of these ammonium cations. Four structural features, including steric effect index, eccentricity, largest ring size, and hydrogen-bond donor, have been identified as the key controlling factors. On the basis of these features, a quantified equation is created to calculate the probability of forming 2D perovskite for a selected amine. To further illustrate its predicting capability, the built model is applied to several untested amines, and the predicted dimensionality is verified by growing single crystals of perovskites from these amines. This work represents a step toward predicting the crystal structures of low dimensional hybrid halide perovskites using ML as a tool.},

   abstract = {Hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites are under intense investigations because of their astounding physical properties and promises for optoelectronics. Lead bromide and chloride perovskites exhibit intrinsic white-light emission believed to arise from self-trapped excitons (STEs). Here, we report a series of new structurally diverse hybrid lead bromide perovskites that have broad-band emission at room temperature. They feature Pb/Br structures which vary from 1D face-sharing structures to 3D corner- and edge-sharing structures. Through single-crystal X-ray diffraction and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, we have identified the local distortion level of the octahedral environments of Pb(2+) within the structures. The band gaps of these compounds range from 2.92 to 3.50 eV, following the trend of "corner-sharing < edge-sharing < face-sharing". Density functional theory calculations suggest that the electronic structure is highly dependent on the connectivity mode of the PbBr(6) octahedra, where the edge- and corner-sharing 1D structure of (2,6-dmpz)(3)Pb(2)Br(10) exhibits more disperse bands and smaller band gap (2.49 eV) than the face-sharing 1D structure of (hep)PbBr(3) (3.10 eV). Using photoemission spectroscopy, we measured the energies of the valence band of these compounds and found them to remain almost constant, while the energy of conduction bands varies. Temperature-dependent PL measurements reveal that the 2D and 3D compounds have narrower PL emission at low temperature ( approximately 5 K), whereas the 1D compounds have both free exciton emission and STE emission. The 1D compound (2,6-dmpz)(3)Pb(2)Br(10) has the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 12%, owing to its unique structure that allows efficient charge carrier relaxation and light emission.},

   abstract = {Hybrid layered halide perovskites have achieved impressive performance in optoelectronics. New structural types in the two-dimensional (2D) halide system such as the Dion-Jacobson phases have attracted wide research attention due to the short interlayer distance and unique layer orientation that facilitate better charge-transport and higher stability in optoelectronic devices. Here, we report the first solid solution series incorporating both A and A' cations in the 2D Dion-Jacobson family, with the general formula (A')(A)Pb(2)Br(7) ((A' = 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP) and 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium) (4AMP); A = methylammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA)). Mixing the spacing A' cations and perovskitizer A cations generates the new (3AMP)(a)(4AMP)(1-a)(FA)(b)(MA)(1-b)Pb(2)Br(7) perovskites. The crystallographically refined crystal structures using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data reveal that the distortion of the inorganic framework is heavily influenced by the degree of A' and A alloying. A rising fraction of 4AMP in the structure, decreases the Pb-Br-Pb angles, making the framework more distorted. On the contrary, higher FA fractions increase the Pb-Br-Pb angles. This structural evolution fine-tunes the optical properties where the larger the Pb-Br-Pb angle, the narrower the band gap. The photoluminescence emission energy mirrors this trend. Raman spectroscopy reveals a highly dynamical lattice similar to MAPbBr(3) and consistent with the local distortion environment of the [Pb(2)Br(7)] framework. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the electronic structures reveal the same trend as the experimental results where (3AMP)(FA)Pb(2)Br(7) has the smallest band gap while (4AMP)(MA)Pb(2)Br(7) has the largest band gap. The structural effects from solely the organic cations in the 2D system highlight the importance of understanding the high sensitivity of the optoelectronic properties on the structural tuning in this broad class of materials.},

   abstract = {The three-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have shown huge potential for use in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. Although these materials are under intense investigation, derivative materials with lower dimensionality are emerging, offering higher tunability of physical properties and new capabilities. Here, we present two new series of hybrid two-dimensional (2D) perovskites that adopt the Dion-Jacobson (DJ) structure type, which are the first complete homologous series reported in halide perovskite chemistry. Lead iodide DJ perovskites adopt a general formula A'A (n-1)Pb (n)I(3 n+1) (A' = 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP) or 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP), A = methylammonium (MA)). These materials have layered structures where the stacking of inorganic layers is unique as they lay exactly on top of another. With a slightly different position of the functional group in the templating cation 3AMP and 4AMP, the as-formed DJ perovskites show different optical properties, with the 3AMP series having smaller band gaps than the 4AMP series. Analysis on the crystal structures and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the origin of the systematic band gap shift is the strong but indirect influence of the organic cation on the inorganic framework. Fabrication of photovoltaic devices utilizing these materials as light absorbers reveals that (3AMP)(MA)(3)Pb(4)I(13) has the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.32%, which is much higher than that of the corresponding (4AMP)(MA)(3)Pb(4)I(13).},

   abstract = {Hybrid halide perovskites have become the "next big thing" in emerging semiconductor materials, as the past decade witnessed their successful application in high-performance photovoltaics. This resurgence has encompassed enormous and widespread development of the three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, spearheaded by CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3). The next generation of halide perovskites, however, is characterized by reduced dimensionality perovskites, emphasizing the two-dimensional (2D) perovskite derivatives which expand the field into a more diverse subgroup of semiconducting hybrids that possesses even higher tunability and excellent photophysical properties. In this Perspective, we begin with a historical flashback to early reports before the "perovskite fever", and we follow this original work to its fruition in the present day, where 2D halide perovskites are in the spotlight of current research, offering characteristics desirable in high-performance optoelectronics. We approach the evolution of 2D halide perovskites from a structural perspective, providing a way to classify the diverse structure types of the materials, which largely dictate the unusual physical properties observed. We sort the 2D hybrid halide perovskites on the basis of two key components: the inorganic layers and their modification, and the organic cation diversity. As these two heterogeneous components blend, either by synthetic manipulation (shuffling the organic cations or inorganic elements) or by application of external stimuli (temperature and pressure), the modular perovskite structure evolves to construct crystallographically defined quantum wells (QWs). The complex electronic structure that arises is sensitive to the structural features that could be in turn used as a knob to control the dielectric and optical properties the QWs. We conclude this Perspective with the most notable achievements in optoelectronic devices that have been demonstrated to date, with an eye toward future material discovery and potential technological developments.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites come as a family (B)(2)(A)(n-1)Pb(n)X(3n+1) (B and A= cations; X= halide). These perovskites are promising semiconductors for solar cells and optoelectronic applications. Among the fascinating properties of these materials is white-light emission, which has been mostly observed in single-layered 2D lead bromide or chloride systems (n = 1), where the broad emission comes from the transient photoexcited states generated by self-trapped excitons (STEs) from structural distortion. Here we report a multilayered 2D perovskite (n = 3) exhibiting a tunable white-light emission. Ethylammonium (EA(+)) can stabilize the 2D perovskite structure in EA(4)Pb(3)Br(10-x)Cl(x) (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9.5, and 10) with EA(+) being both the A and B cations in this system. Because of the larger size of EA, these materials show a high distortion level in their inorganic structures, with EA(4)Pb(3)Cl(10) having a much larger distortion than that of EA(4)Pb(3)Br(10), which results in broadband white-light emission of EA(4)Pb(3)Cl(10) in contrast to narrow blue emission of EA(4)Pb(3)Br(10). The average lifetime of the series decreases gradually from the Cl end to the Br end, indicating that the larger distortion also prolongs the lifetime (more STE states). The band gap of EA(4)Pb(3)Br(10-x)Cl(x) ranges from 3.45 eV (x = 10) to 2.75 eV (x = 0), following Vegard's law. First-principles density functional theory calculations (DFT) show that both EA(4)Pb(3)Cl(10) and EA(4)Pb(3)Br(10) are direct band gap semiconductors. The color rendering index (CRI) of the series improves from 66 (EA(4)Pb(3)Cl(10)) to 83 (EA(4)Pb(3)Br(0.5)Cl(9.5)), displaying high tunability and versatility of the title compounds.},

   abstract = {Hybrid inorganic-organic perovskites are developing rapidly as high performance semiconductors. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites were found to have white-light, broadband emission in the visible range that was attributed mainly to the role of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Here, we describe three new 2D lead bromide perovskites incorporating a series of bifunctional ammonium dications as templates which also emit white light: (1) alpha-(DMEN)PbBr(4) (DMEN = 2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine), which adopts a unique corrugated layered structure in space group Pbca with unit cell a = 18.901(4) A, b = 11.782(2) A, and c = 23.680(5) A; (2) (DMAPA)PbBr(4) (DMAPA = 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine), which crystallizes in P2(1)/c with a = 10.717(2) A, b = 11.735(2) A, c = 12.127(2) A, and beta = 111.53(3) degrees ; and (3) (DMABA)PbBr(4) (DMABA = 4-dimethylaminobutylamine), which adopts Aba2 with a = 41.685(8) A, b = 23.962(5) A, and c = 12.000(2) A. Photoluminescence (PL) studies show a correlation between the distortion of the "PbBr(6)" octahedron in the 2D layer and the broadening of PL emission, with the most distorted structure having the broadest emission (183 nm full width at half-maximum) and longest lifetime (tau(avg) = 1.39 ns). The most distorted member alpha-(DMEN)PbBr(4) exhibits white-light emission with a color rendering index (CRI) of 73 which is similar to a fluorescent light source and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 7863 K, producing "cold" white light.},

   abstract = {Novel functional materials are urgently needed to help combat the major global challenges facing humanity, such as climate change and resource scarcity. Yet, the traditional experimental materials discovery process is slow and the material space at our disposal is too vast to effectively explore using intuition-guided experimentation alone. Most experimental materials discovery programs necessarily focus on exploring the local space of known materials, so we are not fully exploiting the enormous potential material space, where more novel materials with unique properties may exist. Computation, facilitated by improvements in open-source software and databases, as well as computer hardware has the potential to significantly accelerate the rational development of materials, but all too often is only used to postrationalize experimental observations. Thus, the true predictive power of computation, where theory leads experimentation, is not fully utilized. Here, we discuss the challenges to successful implementation of computation-driven materials discovery workflows, and then focus on the progress of the field, with a particular emphasis on the challenges to reaching novel materials.},

   abstract = {Significant progress has been made in both molecular design and fundamental scientific understanding of organic semiconductors (OSCs) in recent years. Suitable charge-carrier mobilities (mu) have been obtained by many high-performance OSCs (mu > 10 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)), but drawbacks remain, including low solution processability and poor thermal durability. In addition, since aggregation of OSCs involves weak intermolecular interactions, the molecules are perpetually in thermal motion, even in the solid state, which disrupts charge-carrier transport. These issues limit potential applications of OSCs. The present work examines a molecular design for hole-transporting (p-type) OSCs based on the "bent-shaped" geometry with specific molecular orbital configurations, which aims to enhance effective intermolecular orbital overlaps, stabilize crystal phases, suppress detrimental molecular motions in the solid state, and improve solution processability. The results indicated that such OSCs have high mu and suitable solution processability, and are resistant to ambient and thermal conditions, making them suitable for practical applications.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are attractive candidates for a variety of optoelectronic applications owing to the unique electronic properties that arise from quantum confinement along a single dimension. Incorporating nonradiative mechanisms that enable directed migration of bound charge carriers, such as Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), could boost device efficiencies provided that FRET rates outpace undesired relaxation pathways. However, predictive models for FRET between distinct 2D states are lacking, particularly with respect to the distance d between a donor and acceptor. We approach FRET in systems with binary mixtures of donor and acceptor 2D perovskite quantum wells (PQWs), and we synthetically tune distances between donor and acceptor by varying alkylammonium spacer cation lengths. FRET rates are monitored using transient absorption spectroscopy and ultrafast photoluminescence, revealing rapid picosecond lifetimes that scale with spacer cation length. We theoretically model these binary mixtures of PQWs, describing the emitters as classical oscillating dipoles. We find agreement with our empirical lifetimes and then determine the effects of lateral extent and layer thickness, establishing fundamental principles for FRET in 2D materials.},

   abstract = {Circularly polarized light (CPL)-sensitive direct detection is attracting increasing attention owing to its various optical technology applications and ultracompact device structures. However, current CPL-sensitive direct detection mainly focuses on a single mode, whereas the visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) dual-modal detection, which is important for improving device sensitivity and night-vision performance, still remains to be explored. Here, for the first time, the vis-NIR dual-modal CPL-sensitive direct detection is presented in bulk single crystals of two-dimensional chiral perovskite (R-BPEA)(2)PbI(4) (R-BPEA = (R)-1-(4-bromophenyl)ethylammonium). Benefiting from the strong light-matter interaction of the layered structure, (R-BPEA)(2)PbI(4) shows a two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient of up to 55 cm/MW, which almost falls around the highest value of 2D hybrid perovskites. Notably, (R-BPEA)(2)PbI(4) exhibits a high vis-NIR dual-modal CPL-sensitive direct detecting performance under both visible light (520 nm) and NIR light (800 nm), with the on/off ratios of current higher than 10(3), and the anisotropy factors for photocurrent higher than 0.1. This work will shed light on the design of new chiral semiconductors with a large TPA coefficient and promote their applications in vis-NIR dual-modal CPL-sensitive direct detection.},

   abstract = {Exceptional molecules and materials with one or more extraordinary properties are both technologically valuable and fundamentally interesting, because they often involve new physical phenomena or new compositions that defy expectations. Historically, exceptionality has been achieved through serendipity, but recently, machine learning (ML) and automated experimentation have been widely proposed to accelerate target identification and synthesis planning. In this Perspective, we argue that the data-driven methods commonly used today are well-suited for optimization but not for the realization of new exceptional materials or molecules. Finding such outliers should be possible using ML, but only by shifting away from using traditional ML approaches that tweak the composition, crystal structure, or reaction pathway. We highlight case studies of high-T(c) oxide superconductors and superhard materials to demonstrate the challenges of ML-guided discovery and discuss the limitations of automation for this task. We then provide six recommendations for the development of ML methods capable of exceptional materials discovery: (i) Avoid the tyranny of the middle and focus on extrema; (ii) When data are limited, qualitative predictions that provide direction are more valuable than interpolative accuracy; (iii) Sample what can be made and how to make it and defer optimization; (iv) Create room (and look) for the unexpected while pursuing your goal; (v) Try to fill-in-the-blanks of input and output space; (vi) Do not confuse human understanding with model interpretability. We conclude with a description of how these recommendations can be integrated into automated discovery workflows, which should enable the discovery of exceptional molecules and materials.},

   abstract = {We present the new homologous series (C(NH(2))(3))(CH(3)NH(3))(n)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 1, 2, 3) of layered 2D perovskites. Structural characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that these compounds adopt an unprecedented structure type, which is stabilized by the alternating ordering of the guanidinium and methylammonium cations in the interlayer space (ACI). Compared to the more common Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) 2D perovskites, the ACI perovskites have a different stacking motif and adopt a higher crystal symmetry. The higher symmetry of the ACI perovskites is expressed in their physical properties, which show a characteristic decrease of the bandgap with respect to their RP perovskite counterparts with the same perovskite layer thickness (n). The compounds show a monotonic decrease in the optical gap as n increases: E(g) = 2.27 eV for n = 1 to E(g) = 1.99 eV for n = 2 and E(g) = 1.73 eV for n = 3, which show slightly narrower gaps compared to the corresponding RP perovskites. First-principles theoretical electronic structure calculations confirm the experimental optical gap trends suggesting that the ACI perovskites are direct bandgap semiconductors with wide valence and conduction bandwidths. To assess the potential of the ACI perovskites toward solar cell applications, we studied the (C(NH(2))(3))(CH(3)NH(3))(3)Pb(3)I(10) (n = 3) compound. Compact thin films from the (C(NH(2))(3))(CH(3)NH(3))(3)Pb(3)I(10) compound with excellent surface coverage can be obtained from the antisolvent dripping method. Planar photovoltaic devices from optimized ACI perovskite films yield a power-conversion-efficiency of 7.26% with a high open-circuit voltage of approximately 1 V and a striking fill factor of approximately 80%.},

   abstract = {The unique hybrid nature of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) perovskites has bestowed upon them not only tunability of their electronic properties but also high-performance electronic devices with improved environmental stability as compared to their 3D analogs. However, there is limited information about their inherent heat, light, and air stability and how different parameters such as the inorganic layer number and length of organic spacer molecule affect stability. To gain deeper understanding on the matter we have expanded the family of 2D R-P perovskites, by utilizing pentylamine (PA)(2)(MA) (n-1)Pb (n)I(3 n+1) ( n = 1-5, PA = CH(3)(CH(2))(4)NH(3)(+), C5) and hexylamine (HA)(2)(MA) (n-1)Pb (n)I(3 n+1) ( n = 1-4, HA = CH(3)(CH(2))(5)NH(3)(+), C6) as the organic spacer molecules between the inorganic slabs, creating two new series of layered materials, for up to n = 5 and 4 layers, respectively. The resulting compounds were extensively characterized through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods, including single crystal X-ray analysis. High resolution powder X-ray diffraction studies using synchrotron radiation shed light for the first time to the phase transitions of the higher layer 2D R-P perovskites. The increase in the length of the organic spacer molecules did not affect their optical properties; however, it has a pronounced effect on the air, heat, and light stability of the fabricated thin films. An extensive study of heat, light, and air stability with and without encapsulation revealed that specific compounds can be air stable (relative humidity (RH) = 20-80% +/- 5%) for more than 450 days, while heat and light stability in air can be exponentially increased by encapsulating the corresponding films. Evaluation of the out-of-plane mechanical properties of the corresponding materials showed that their soft and flexible nature can be compared to current commercially available polymer substrates (e.g., PMMA), rendering them suitable for fabricating flexible and wearable electronic devices.},

   abstract = {Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled breakthroughs across many scientific disciplines. In organic chemistry, the challenge of planning complex multistep chemical syntheses should conceptually be well-suited for AI. Yet, the development of AI synthesis planners trained solely on reaction-example-data has stagnated and is not on par with the performance of "hybrid" algorithms combining AI with expert knowledge. This Perspective examines possible causes of these shortcomings, extending beyond the established reasoning of insufficient quantities of reaction data. Drawing attention to the intricacies and data biases that are specific to the domain of synthetic chemistry, we advocate augmenting the unique capabilities of AI with the knowledge base and the reasoning strategies of domain experts. By actively involving synthetic chemists, who are the end users of any synthesis planning software, into the development process, we envision to bridge the gap between computer algorithms and the intricate nature of chemical synthesis.},

   abstract = {Halide perovskites have attracted a great amount of attention owing to their unique materials chemistry, excellent electronic properties, and low-cost manufacturing. Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, originating from three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structures, are structurally more diverse and therefore create functional possibilities beyond 3D perovskites. The much less restrictive size constraints on the organic component of these hybrid materials particularly provide an exciting platform for designing unprecedented materials and functionalities at the molecular level. In this Perspective, we discuss the concept and recent development of a sub-class of 2D perovskites, namely, organic semiconductor-incorporated perovskites (OSiPs). OSiPs combine the electronic functionality of organic semiconductors with the soft and dynamic halide perovskite lattice, offering opportunities for tailoring the energy landscape, lattice and carrier dynamics, and electron/ion transport properties for various fundamental studies, as well as device applications. Specifically, we summarize recent advances in the design, synthesis, and structural analysis of OSiPs with various organic conjugated moieties as well as the application of OSiPs in photovoltaics, light-emitting devices, and transistors. Lastly, challenges and further opportunities for OSiPs in molecular design, integration of novel functionality, film quality, and stability issues are addressed.},

   abstract = {Chiral perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their potential applications in spintronic- and polarization-based optoelectronic devices. However, the structural chirality/asymmetry transfer mechanism between chiral organic ammoniums and achiral inorganic frameworks is still equivocal, especially under extreme conditions, as the systematic structural differences between chiral and achiral perovskites have been rarely explored. Herein, we successfully synthesized a pair of new enantiomeric chiral perovskite (S/R-3PYEA)PbI(4) (3PYEA(2+) = C(5)NH(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3)(2+)) and an achiral perovskite (rac-3PYEA)PbI(4). Hydrostatic pressure was used, for the first time, to systematically investigate the differences in the structural evolution and optical behavior between (S/R-3PYEA)PbI(4) and (rac-3PYEA)PbI(4). At approximately 7.0 GPa, (S/R-3PYEA)PbI(4) exhibits a chirality-dependent structural transformation with a bandgap "red jump" and dramatic piezochromism from translucent red to opaque black. Upon further compression, a previously unreported chirality-induced negative linear compressibility (NLC) is achieved in (S/R-3PYEA)PbI(4). High-pressure structural characterizations and first-principles calculations demonstrate that pressure-driven homodirectional tilting of homochiral ammonium cations strengthens the interactions between S/R-3PYEA(2+) and Pb-I frameworks, inducing the formation of new asymmetric hydrogen bonds N-H...I-Pb in (S/R-3PYEA)PbI(4). The enhanced asymmetric H-bonding interactions further break the symmetry of (S/R-3PYEA)PbI(4) and trigger a greater degree of in-plane and out-of-plane distortion of [PbI(6)](4-) octahedra, which are responsible for chirality-dependent structural phase transition and NLC, respectively. Nevertheless, the balanced H-bonds incurred by equal proportions of S-3PYEA(2+) and R-3PYEA(2+) counteract the tilting force, leading to the absence of chirality-dependent structural transition, spectral "red jump", and NLC in (rac-3PYEA)PbI(4).},

   abstract = {The nature of the organic cation in two-dimensional (2D) hybrid lead iodide perovskites tailors the structural and technological features of the resultant material. Herein, we present three new homologous series of (100) lead iodide perovskites with the organic cations allylammonium (AA) containing an unsaturated C horizontal lineC group and iodopropylammonium (IdPA) containing iodine on the organic chain: (AA)(2)MA(n)(-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 3-4), [(AA)(x)(IdPA)(1-x)](2)MA(n)(-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 1-4), and (IdPA)(2)MA(n)(-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 1-4), as well as their perovskite-related substructures. We report the in situ transformation of AA organic layers into IdPA and the incorporation of these cations simultaneously into the 2D perovskite structure. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction shows that (AA)(2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10) crystallizes in the space group P2(1)/c with a unique inorganic layer offset (0, <1/2), comprising the first example of n = 3 halide perovskite with a monoammonium cation that deviates from the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) halide structure type. (IdPA)(2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10) and the alloyed [(AA)(x)(IdPA)(1-x)](2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10) crystallize in the RP structure, both in space group P2(1)/c. The adjacent I...I interlayer distance in (AA)(2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10) is approximately 5.6 A, drawing the [Pb(3)I(10)](4-) layers closer together among all reported n = 3 RP lead iodides. (AA)(2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10) presents band-edge absorption and photoluminescence (PL) emission at around 2.0 eV that is slightly red-shifted in comparison to (IdPA)(2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10). The band structure calculations suggest that both (AA)(2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10) and (IdPA)(2)MA(2)Pb(3)I(10) have in-plane effective masses around 0.04m(0) and 0.08m(0), respectively. IdPA cations have a greater dielectric contribution than AA. The excited-state dynamics investigated by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy reveal a long-lived ( approximately 100 ps) trap state ensemble with broad-band emission; our evidence suggests that these states appear due to lattice distortions induced by the incorporation of IdPA cations.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites are a preeminent class of low-cost semiconductors whose inherent structural tunability and attractive photophysical properties have led to the successful fabrication of solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies. Despite the observed superior stability of 2D lead iodide perovskites over their 3D parent structures, an understanding of their thermochemical profile is missing. Herein, the calorimetric studies reveal that the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) series, incorporating the monovalent-monoammonium spacer cations of pentylammonium (PA) and hexylammonium (HA): (PA)(2)(MA)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 2-6) and (HA)(2)(MA)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 2-4) have a negative enthalpy of formation, relative to their binary iodides. In contrast, the enthalpy of formation for the Dion-Jacobson (DJ) series, incorporating the divalent and cyclic diammonium cations of 3- and 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP and 4AMP respectively): (3AMP)(MA)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 2-5) and (4AMP)(MA)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) (n = 2-4) have a positive enthalpy of formation. In addition, for the (PA)(2)(MA)(n-1)Pb(n)I(3n+1) family of materials, we report the phase-pure synthesis and single crystal structure of the next member of the series (PA)(2)(MA)(5)Pb(6)I(19) (n = 6), and its optical properties, marking this the second n = 6, bulk member published to date. Particularly, (PA)(2)(MA)(5)Pb(6)I(19) (n = 6) has negative enthalpy of formation as well. Additionally, the analysis of the structural parameters and optical properties between the examined RP and DJ series offers guiding principles for the targeted design and synthesis of 2D perovskites for efficient solar cell fabrication. Although the distortions of the Pb-I-Pb equatorial angles are larger in the DJ series, the significantly smaller I...I interlayer distances lead to overall smaller band gap values, in comparison with the RP series. Our film stability studies on the RP and DJ perovskites series reveal consistent observations with the thermochemical findings, pointing out to the lower extrinsic stability of the DJ materials in ambient air.},

Progress on such materials has hitherto been limited to compounds containing main group 3+ ions isoelectronic with Pb(II) (such as Sb(III) and Bi(III)). Here, we report eight HLDP halides from the A(2)M(I)M(III)X(8) family, where A = para-phenylenediammonium (PPDA), 1,4-butanediammonium (1,4-BDA), or 1,3-propanediammonium (1,3-PDA); M(I) = Cu or Ag; M(III) = Ru or Mo; X = Cl or Br. The optical band gaps, which lie in the range 1.55 to 2.05 eV, are tunable according to the layer composition, but are largely independent of the spacer. Magnetic measurements carried out for (PPDA)(2)Ag(I)Ru(III)Cl(8) and (PPDA)(2)Ag(I)Mo(III)Cl(8) show no obvious evidence of a magnetic ordering transition. While the t(2g)(3) Mo(III) compound displays Curie-Weiss behavior for a spin-only d(3) ion, the t(2g)(5) Ru(III) compound displays marked deviations from the Kotani theory.},

   abstract = {pi-Conjugated two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are emerging as a novel class of electroactive materials for (opto)electronic and chemiresistive sensing applications. However, understanding the intricate interplay between chemistry, structure, and conductivity in pi-conjugated 2D COFs remains elusive. Here, we report a detailed characterization for the electronic properties of two novel samples consisting of Zn- and Cu-phthalocyanine-based pyrazine-linked 2D COFs. These 2D COFs are synthesized by condensation of metal-phthalocyanine (M = Zn and Cu) and pyrene derivatives. The obtained polycrystalline-layered COFs are p-type semiconductors both with a band gap of approximately 1.2 eV. A record device-relevant mobility up to approximately 5 cm(2)/(V s) is resolved in the dc limit, which represents a lower threshold induced by charge carrier localization at crystalline grain boundaries. Hall effect measurements (dc limit) and terahertz (THz) spectroscopy (ac limit) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that varying metal center from Cu to Zn in the phthalocyanine moiety has a negligible effect in the conductivity ( approximately 5 x 10(-7) S/cm), charge carrier density ( approximately 10(12) cm(-3)), charge carrier scattering rate ( approximately 3 x 10(13) s(-1)), and effective mass ( approximately 2.3m(0)) of majority carriers (holes). Notably, charge carrier transport is found to be anisotropic, with hole mobilities being practically null in-plane and finite out-of-plane for these 2D COFs.},

   abstract = {Learning microscopic properties of a material from its macroscopic measurables is a grand and challenging goal in physical science. Conventional wisdom is to first identify material structures exploiting characterization tools, such as spectroscopy, and then to infer properties of interest, often with assistance of theory and simulations. This indirect approach has limitations due to the accumulation of errors from retrieving structures from spectral signals and the lack of quantitative structure-property relationship. A new pathway directly from spectral signals to microscopic properties is highly desirable, as it would offer valuable guidance toward materials evaluation and design via spectroscopic measurements. Herein, we exploit machine-learned vibrational spectroscopy to establish quantitative spectrum-property relationships. Key interaction properties of substrate-adsorbate systems, including adsorption energy and charge transfer, are quantitatively determined directly from Infrared and Raman spectroscopic signals of the adsorbates. The machine-learned spectrum-property relationships are presented as mathematical formulas, which are physically interpretable and therefore transferrable to a series of metal/alloy surfaces. The demonstrated ability of quantitative determination of hard-to-measure microscopic properties using machine-learned spectroscopy will significantly broaden the applicability of conventional spectroscopic techniques for materials design and high throughput screening under operando conditions.},

   abstract = {The challenge of evaluating catalyst surface-molecular adsorbate interactions holds the key for rational design of catalysts. Finding an experimentally measurable and theoretically computable descriptor for evaluating surface-adsorbate interactions is a significant step toward achieving this goal. Here we show that the electric dipole moment can serve as a convenient yet accurate descriptor for establishing structure-property relationships for molecular adsorbates on metal catalyst surfaces. By training a machine learning neural network with a large data set of first-principles calculations, we achieve quick and accurate predictions of molecular adsorption energy and transferred charge. The training model using NO/CO@Au(111) can be extended to study additional substrates such as Au(001) or Ag(111), thus exhibiting extraordinary transferability. These findings validate the effectiveness of the electric dipole descriptor, providing an efficient modality for future catalyst design.},

These new perovskites feature an unprecedented combination of chirality and alkyl-aryl functionality alongside noncovalent intermolecular interactions (e.g., CH...pi interactions), determined by their crystal structures. The mixed-cation perovskites exhibit a circular dichroism that is markedly different from the purely chiral cation analogues, offering new avenues to tune the chiroptical properties of known chiral perovskites, instead of solely relying on otherwise complex chemical syntheses of new useable chiral cations. Further, the ability to dilute the density of chiral cations by mixing with achiral cations may offer a potential way to tailor the spin-based properties in 2D hybrid perovskites, such as Rashba-Dresselhaus spin splitting and chirality-induced spin selectivity and magnetization effects.},

   abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has depicted a beautiful blueprint for on-demand design in chemical research. However, the few successful chemical generations have only been able to implement a few special property values because most chemical descriptors are mathematically discrete or discontinuously adjustable. Herein, we use spectroscopic descriptors with machine learning to establish a quantitative spectral structure-property relationship for adsorbed molecules on metal monatomic catalysts. Besides catalytic properties such as adsorption energy and charge transfer, the complete spatial relative coordinates of the adsorbed molecule were successfully inverted. The spectroscopic descriptors and prediction models are generalized, allowing them to be transferred to several different systems. Due to the continuous tunability of the spectroscopic descriptors, the design of catalytic structures with continuous adsorption states generated by AI in the catalytic process has been achieved. This work paves the way for using spectroscopy to enable real-time monitoring of the catalytic process and continuous customization of catalytic performance, which will lead to profound changes in catalytic research.},

However, deciphering protein structures from experimental amide II spectra relies on time-consuming quantum chemical calculations on tens of thousands of representative configurations in solvent water. Currently, the accurate simulation of amide II spectra for whole proteins remains a challenge. Here, we present a machine learning (ML)-based protocol designed to efficiently simulate the amide II IR spectra of various proteins with an accuracy comparable to experimental results. This protocol stands out as a cost-effective and efficient alternative for studying protein dynamics, including the identification of secondary structures and monitoring the dynamics of protein hydrogen bonding under different pH conditions and during protein folding process. Our method provides a valuable tool in the field of protein research, focusing on the study of dynamic properties of proteins, especially those related to hydrogen bonding, using amide II IR spectroscopy.},

   abstract = {Organic-inorganic halide perovskites incorporating two-dimensional (2D) structures have shown promise for enhancing the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the bulky spacer cations often limit charge transport. Here, we report on a simple approach based on molecular design of the organic spacer to improve the transport properties of 2D perovskites, and we use phenethylammonium (PEA) as an example. We demonstrate that by fluorine substitution on the para position in PEA to form 4-fluorophenethylammonium (F-PEA), the average phenyl ring centroid-centroid distances in the organic layer become shorter with better aligned stacking of perovskite sheets. The impact is enhanced orbital interactions and charge transport across adjacent inorganic layers as well as increased carrier lifetime and reduced trap density. Using a simple perovskite deposition at room temperature without using any additives, we obtained a power conversion efficiency of >13% for (F-PEA)(2)MA(4)Pb(5)I(16)-based PSCs. In addition, the thermal stability of 2D PSCs based on F-PEA is significantly enhanced compared to those based on PEA.},

   abstract = {The two-dimensional (2D) perovskites stabilized by alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) define a new type of structure with different physical properties than the more common Ruddlesden-Popper counterparts. However, there is a lack of understanding of material crystallization in films and its influence on the morphological/optoelectronic properties and the final photovoltaic devices. Herein, we undertake in situ studies of the solidification process for ACI 2D perovskite (GA)(MA) (n)Pb (n)I(3 n+1) (⟨ n⟩ = 3) from ink to solid-state semiconductor, using solvent mixture of DMSO:DMF (1:10 v/v) as the solvent and link this behavior to solar cell devices. The in situ grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis reveals a complex journey through disordered sol-gel precursors, intermediate phases, and ultimately to ACI perovskites. The intermediate phases, including a crystalline solvate compound and the 2D GA(2)PbI(4) perovskite, provide a scaffold for the growth of the ACI perovskites during thermal annealing. We identify 2D GA(2)PbI(4) to be the key intermediate phase, which is strongly influenced by the deposition technique and determines the formation of the 1D GAPbI(3) byproducts and the distribution of various n phases of ACI perovskites in the final films. We also confirm the presence of internal charge transfer between different n phases through transient absorption spectroscopy. The high quality ACI perovskite films deposited from solvent mixture of DMSO:DMF (1:10 v/v) deliver a record power conversion efficiency of 14.7% in planar solar cells and significantly enhanced long-term stability of devices in contrast to the 3D MAPbI(3) counterpart.},

   abstract = {Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have garnered widespread interest, yet stability remains a critical issue that limits their further application. Compared to their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, two-dimensional (2D)-HOIPs exhibit improved stability. 2D-HOIPs are also appealing because their structural and optical properties can be tuned according to the choice of organic ligand, with monovalent or divalent ligands forming Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) or Dion-Jacobson (DJ)-type 2D perovskites, respectively. Unlike RP-type 2D perovskites, DJ-type 2D perovskites do not contain a van der Waals gap between the 2D layers, leading to improved stability. However, bifunctional organic ligands currently used to develop DJ-type 2D perovskites are limited to commercially available aliphatic and single-ring aromatic ammonium cations. Large conjugated organic ligands are in demand for their semiconducting properties and their potential to improve materials stability further. In this manuscript, we report the design and synthesis of a new set of larger conjugated diamine ligands and their incorporation into DJ-type 2D perovskites. Compared with analogous RP-type 2D perovskites, DJ 2D perovskites reported here show blue-shifted, narrower emissions and significantly improved stability. By changing the structure of rings (benzene vs thiophene) and substituents, we develop structure-property relationships, finding that fluorine substitution enhances crystallinity. Single-crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations indicate that these changes are due to strong electrostatic interactions between the organic templates and inorganic layers as well as the rigid backbone and strong pi-pi interaction between the organic ligands themselves. These results illustrate that targeted engineering of the diamine ligands can enhance the stability of DJ-type 2D perovskites.},

   abstract = {The electrocatalytic activity of transition-metal-based compounds is strongly related to the spin states. However, the underlying relationship connecting spin to catalytic activity remains unclear. Herein, we carried out density functional theory calculations on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by Fe single-atom supported on C(2)N (C(2)N-Fe) to shed light on this relationship. It is found that the change of electronic spin moments of Fe and O(2) due to molecular-catalyst adsorption scales with the amount of electron transfer from Fe to O(2), which promotes the catalytic activity of C(2)N-Fe for driving ORR. The nearly linear relationship between the catalytic activity and spin moment variation suggests electronic spin moment as a promising catalytic descriptor for Fe single-atom based catalysts. Following the revealed relationship, the ORR barrier on C(2)N-Fe was tuned to be as low as 0.10 eV through judicious manipulation of spin states. These findings thus provide important insights into the relationship between catalytic activity and spin, leading to new strategies for designing transition metal single-atom catalysts.},

   abstract = {Modern materials discovery and design studies often rely on the computational screening of large databases. Complementing experimental databases, virtual databases are thereby increasingly established through the first-principles calculation of computationally inexpensive, but for a given application, decisive microscopic quantities of the system. These so-called descriptors are calculated for vast numbers of candidate materials. In general, the sheer volume of datapoints generated in such studies precludes an in depth human analysis. To this end, smart visualization techniques, based e.g., on so-called chemical space networks (CSN), have been developed to extract general design rules connecting structural modifications to changes in the target functionality. In this work, we generate and visualize the CSN of possible crystalline organic semiconductors based on an in-house database of > 64,000 molecular crystals that we extracted from the exhaustive Cambridge Structural Database and for which we computed prominent charge-mobility descriptors. Our CSN thereby links clusters of molecular crystals based on the chemical similarity of the scaffolds of their molecular building blocks and thus groups communities of similar molecules. Including each cluster's median descriptor values, the CSN visualization not only reproduces known trends of good organic semiconductors but also allows us to extract general design rules for organic molecular scaffolds. Finally, the local environment of each scaffold in our visualization shows how thoroughly its local chemical space has already been explored synthetically. Of special interest here are those clusters with promising descriptor values, yet with little or no connections in the sampled chemical space, as these offer the most room for scaffold optimization.},

   abstract = {Forecasting the structural stability of hybrid organic/inorganic compounds, where polyatomic molecules replace atoms, is a challenging task; the composition space is vast, and the reference structure for the organic molecules is ambiguously defined. In this work, we use a range of machine-learning algorithms, constructed from state-of-the-art density functional theory data, to conduct a systematic analysis on the likelihood of a given cation to be housed in the perovskite structure. In particular, we consider both ABC(3) chalcogenide (I-V-VI(3)) and halide (I-II-VII(3)) perovskites. We find that the effective atomic radius and the number of lone pairs residing on the A-site cation are sufficient features to describe the perovskite phase stability. Thus, the presented machine-learning approach provides an efficient way to map the phase stability of the vast class of compounds, including situations where a cation mixture replaces a single A-site cation. This work demonstrates that advanced electronic structure theory combined with machine-learning analysis can provide an efficient strategy superior to the conventional trial-and-error approach in materials design.},

   abstract = {Layered hybrid perovskites based on Dion-Jacobson phases are of interest to various optoelectronic applications. However, the understanding of their structure-property relationships remains limited. Here, we present a systematic study of Dion-Jacobson perovskites based on (S)PbX(4) (n = 1) compositions incorporating phenylene-derived aromatic spacers (S) with different anchoring alkylammonium groups and halides (X = I, Br). We focus our study on 1,4-phenylenediammonium (PDA), 1,4-phenylenedimethylammonium (PDMA), and 1,4-phenylenediethylammonium (PDEA) spacers. Systems based on PDA did not form a well-defined layered structure, showing the formation of a 1D structure instead, whereas the extension of the alkyl chains to PDMA and PDEA rendered them compatible with the formation of a layered structure, as shown by X-ray diffraction and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the control of the spacer length affects optical properties and environmental stability, which is enhanced for longer alkyl chains and bromide compositions. This provides insights into their design for optoelectronic applications.},

   abstract = {Low-dimensional metal halide perovskites are being intensively investigated because of their higher stability and chemical versatility in comparison to their 3D counterparts. Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of the electronic and charge transport properties, limited by the reduced perovskite dimensionality. Cation engineering can be envisaged as a solution to tune and possibly further improve the material's optoelectronic properties. In this work, we screen and design new electronically active A-site cations that can promote charge transport across the inorganic layers. We show that hybridization of the valence band electronic states of the perovskite inorganic sublattice and the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the A-site organic cations can be tuned to exhibit a variety of optoelectronic properties. A significant interplay of A-cation size, electronic structure, and steric constraints is revealed, suggesting intriguing means of further tuning the 2D perovskite electronic structure toward achieving stable and efficient solar cell devices.},

Thus we readily find many acclaimed compounds as well as a number of most promising materials that have not yet been considered for an application in organic electronics.

While Hirshfeld Surface Analysis is a well-established tool in organic crystallography, we also introduce modified computational protocols for Hirshfeld Surface Analysis tailored specifically to account for nuanced but important differences dealing with inorganic crystals. We demonstrate how two-dimensional Hirshfeld surface fingerprints can serve as a rich "database" of information encoding the complexity of relationships between chemical bonding and bond geometry characteristics of perovskites. Our results are compared with other studies on lattice parameter prediction involving both experimental and computationally derived data, and it is shown that our approach is an improvement over other reported methods.

   abstract = {In two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, four distinct types of intramolecular band alignment (Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb) can be formed between the organic and inorganic components. Molecular design to achieve desirable band alignments is of crucial importance to the applications of 2D perovskites and their heterostructures. In this work, by means of first-principles calculations, we have developed molecular design strategies that lead to the discovery of 2D halide perovskites with favorable band alignments toward light-emitting and photovoltaic applications. The same design strategies can be extended to vertical and lateral heterostructures of 2D perovskites with selective light emissions from the organic and/or inorganic layer of constituent 2D perovskites. For each intramolecular band alignment, the charge density and binding energy of the lowest energy exciton are examined. The effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the band structures is assessed. While SOC significantly lowers the band gaps in type-Ia and type-IIa alignments, it has a negligible effect in type-Ib and type-IIb alignments.},

However, controversies abound in literature on the band alignment of the 2D perovskite heterostructures. While external factors have been sought to reconcile the controversies, we show that the 2D perovskite heterostructures are in fact intrinsically prone to band "misalignment", driven by thermal fluctuations. Owing to the "softness" of inorganic layers in the perovskites, electron-phonon coupling at room temperature could be strong enough to override band offsets at zero temperature, leading to oscillatory band alignment between type-I and type-II at 300 K. We further demonstrate that by tuning the inorganic layers, one can increase the band offsets and stabilize the band alignment, paving the way for optoelectronic applications of the 2D perovskite heterostructures.},

   abstract = {Predicting the formability of perovskite structure for hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is a prominent challenge in the search for the required materials from a huge search space. Here, we propose an interpretable strategy combining machine learning with a shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach to accelerate the discovery of potential HOIPs. According to the prediction of the best classification model, top-198 nontoxic candidates with a probability of formability (P(f)) of >0.99 are screened from 18560 virtual samples. The SHAP analysis reveals that the radius and lattice constant of the B site (r(B) and LC(B)) are positively related to formability, while the ionic radius of the A site (r(A)), the tolerant factor (t), and the first ionization energy of the B site (I(1B)) have negative relations. The significant finding is that stricter ranges of t (0.84-1.12) and improved tolerant factor tau (critical value of 6.20) do exist for HOIPs, which are different from inorganic perovskites, providing a simple and fast assessment in the design of materials with an HOIP structure.},

   abstract = {As a fundamental problem in chemistry, retrosynthesis aims at designing reaction pathways and intermediates for a target compound. The goal of artificial intelligence (AI)-aided retrosynthesis is to automate this process by learning from the previous chemical reactions to make new predictions. Although several models have demonstrated their potentials for automated retrosynthesis, there is still a significant need to further enhance the prediction accuracy to a more practical level. Here we propose a local retrosynthesis framework called LocalRetro, motivated by the chemical intuition that the molecular changes occur mostly locally during the chemical reactions. This differs from nearly all existing retrosynthesis methods that suggest reactants based on the global structures of the molecules, often containing fine details not directly relevant to the reactions. This local concept yields local reaction templates involving the atom and bond edits. Because the remote functional groups can also affect the overall reaction path as a secondary aspect, the proposed locally encoded retrosynthesis model is then further refined to account for the nonlocal effects of chemical reaction through a global attention mechanism. Our model shows a promising 89.5 and 99.2% round-trip accuracy at top-1 and top-5 predictions for the USPTO-50K dataset containing 50 016 reactions. We further demonstrate the validity of LocalRetro on a large dataset containing 479 035 reactions (UTPTO-MIT) with comparable round-trip top-1 and top-5 accuracy of 87.0 and 97.4%, respectively. The practical application of the model is also demonstrated by correctly predicting the synthesis pathways of five drug candidate molecules from various literature.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are emerging as promising candidates for diverse optoelectronic applications because of low cost and excellent stability. In this work, we explore the electronic structures and interfacial properties of (4Tm)2PbI4 with both the collinear and noncollinear DFT (PBE and HSE06) methods. The results evidently manifest that explicitly considering the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects is necessary to attain correct band alignment of (4Tm)2PbI4 that agrees with recent experiments (Nat. Chem.2019, 11, 1151; Nature2020, 580, 614). The subsequent time-domain noncollinear DFT-based nonadiabatic carrier dynamics simulations with the SOC effects reveal that the photoinduced electron and hole transfer processes are asymmetric and associated with different rates. The differences are mainly ascribed to considerably different nonadiabatic couplings in charge of the electron and hole transfer processes. Shortly, our current work sheds important light on the mechanism of the interfacial charge carrier transfer processes of (4Tm)2PbI4. The importance of the SOC effects on correctly aligning the band states of (4Tm)2PbI4 may be generalized to similar organic-inorganic hybrid 2D perovskites having heavy Pb atoms.},

The ML model is able to not only simulate protein CD spectra nearly 4 orders of magnitude faster than conventional first-principle simulation but also obtain CD spectra in good agreement with experiments. Finally, we predicted a series of CD spectra of the Trp-cage protein associated with continuous changes of protein configuration along its folding path, showing the potential of our ML model for supporting real-time CD spectroscopy study of protein dynamics.},

   abstract = {Organic-inorganic perovskite structured compounds have recently emerged as attractive materials in the fields of photovoltaic due to their exciting optical properties and easy syntheses, as well as exceptional structural and optical tunability. This work presents a Dion-Jacobson two-dimensional (2D) perovskite using diammonium as the barrier molecule. We show that the diammonium barrier molecule is responsible for the perovskite layers' orientation supported by Hall Effect measurements, which results in a high efficiency solar cell for 2D perovskite without the need for additives or any additional treatment. The 2D perovskite cells achieved an efficiency of 15.6%, which was one of the highest reported for low-dimensional perovskite. Charge extraction, voltage decay, and charge collection efficiency measurements show the beneficial alignment of the 2D perovskites related to the selective contacts. Stability characterization shows that the stability for the 2D perovskite was enhanced compared with their 3D counterparts.},

   abstract = {The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.},

   abstract = {Surface states are ubiquitous to semiconductors and significantly impact the physical properties and, consequently, the performance of optoelectronic devices. Moreover, surface effects are strongly amplified in lower dimensional systems such as quantum wells and nanostructures. Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) are two-dimensional solution-processed natural quantum wells where optoelectronic properties can be tuned by varying the perovskite layer thickness n, i.e., the number of octahedra spanning the layer. They are efficient semiconductors with technologically relevant stability. Here, a generic elastic model and electronic structure modeling are applied to LHPs heterostructures with various layer thickness. We show that the relaxation of the interface strain is triggered by perovskite layers above a critical thickness. This leads to the release of the mechanical energy arising from the lattice mismatch, which nucleates the surface reorganization and may potentially induce the formation of previously observed lower energy edge states. These states, which are absent in three-dimensional perovskites are anticipated to play a crucial role in the design of LHPs for optoelectronic systems.},

Two-dimensional (2D) perovskite analogues feature greater stability toward environmental factors, such as moisture, owing to a hydrophobic organic cation that acts as a spacer between the inorganic layers, which offers a significant advantage over their comparatively less stable 3D analogues. Here, we demonstrate the first example of a formamidinium (FA) containing Dion-Jacobson 2D perovskite material characterized by the BFA (n-1)Pb (n)I(3 n+1) formulation through employing a novel bifunctional organic spacer (B), namely 1,4-phenylenedimethanammonium (PDMA).

   abstract = {Two-dimensional Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have shown improved structure stability in comparison with Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites. However, the mechanism behind the improved stability is still largely unexplored. Here a multifluorinated aromatic spacer, namely, 4F-PhDMA, has been successfully developed for 2D DJ perovskites. It is found that the 2D DJ perovskite with a 4F-PhDMA spacer exhibits a high dissociation energy due to the multiple noncovalent interactions. The optimized 2D DJ device based on the 4F-PhDMA spacer (n = 4) exhibits a champion efficiency of 16.62% with much improved light and thermal stability. This efficiency is much higher than that of the control device using an unfluorinated spacer (n = 4, PCE = 10.11%) and is among the highest efficiencies in aromatic-spacer-based 2D DJ perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our work highlights the importance of incorporating multiple noncovalent interactions in the 2D DJ perovskite by employing a multifluorinated aromatic spacer to achieve DJ PSCs with both high efficiency and high stability.},

   abstract = {Layered two dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D perovskites are emerging photovoltaic materials due to their superior environment and structure stability in comparison with their 3D counterparts. The typical 2D perovskites can be obtained by cutting 3D perovskites along < 100 > orientation by incorporation of bulky organic spacers, which play a key role in the performance of 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Compared with aliphatic spacers, aromatic spacers with high dielectric constant have the potential to decrease the dielectric and quantum confinement effect of 2D perovskites, promote efficient charge transport and reduce the exciton binding energy, all of which are beneficial for the photovoltaic performance of 2D PSCs. In this review, we aim to provide useful guidelines for the design of aromatic spacers for 2D perovskites. We systematically reviewed the recent progress of aromatic spacers used in 2D PSCs. Finally, we propose the possible design strategies for aromatic spacers that may lead to more efficient and stable 2D PSCs.},

Based on the advantages of 2D perovskites, such as special energy funnel process, ultra-fast energy transfer, dense film and low efficiency roll-off, the remarkable achievements of 2D perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are summarized, and exciting challenges of 2D perovskite are also discussed. An outlook on further improving the efficiency of pure-blue PeLEDs, enhancing the operational stability of PeLEDs and reducing the toxicity to push this field forward was also provided.

   abstract = {2D layered hybrid perovskites have attracted huge attention due to their interesting optoelectronic properties and chemical flexibility. Depending upon their electronic structures and properties, these materials can be utilised in various optoelectronic devices like photovoltaics, LEDs and so on. In this context, study of the excited energy levels of the organic spacers can help us to align the excited energy levels of the organic unit with the excitonic level of the inorganic unit according to the requirement of a particular optoelectronic device. We have explored the role of 3-phenyl-2-propenammonium on the electronic structure of a perovskite containing this cation as a spacer. Our results clearly demonstrate the active participation of conjugated ammonium spacers in the electronic structure of a perovskite. Also, we have considered a variety of amines to identify the best alignment with common inorganic units and studied the role of substituents and conjugation on the energy level alignment. Placing the triplet excited level of an organic spacer below the lowest excitonic level of the inorganic unit can induce energy transfer from the inorganic to organic unit, finally resulting in phosphorescence emission. We have shown that the triplet energy level of 3-anthracene-2-propeneamine/3-pyrene-2-propeneamine can be tuned in such a way that there can be an excitonic energy transfer from the Pb(2)I(7)/PbI(4) inorganic unit-based perovskites. Therefore, perovskite material with such combinations of organic spacer cations will be very useful for light emission applications.},

   abstract = {Dimensionality is the game-changer property of a material. The optical and electronic properties of a compound get dramatically influenced by confining dimensions from 3D to 2D. The bulk 3D perovskite materials have shown remarkable up-gradation in the power conversion efficiency, hence grabbing worldwide attention. But instability against moisture, temperature, and ion migration are the factors constantly back-stabbing and hindering from full-scale commercialization. 2D perovskite material has emerged as an excellent bridging entity between structural-chemical stability, and viable commercialization. Organic-inorganic 2D perovskite materials come with a layered structure in which a large organic cation layer as a spacer is sandwiched between two inorganic metal halide octahedra layers. Moreover, hydrophobic spacer cations are employed which isolate inorganic octahedral layers from water molecules. Hydrophobic spacer cations protect the authentic structure from being degraded. These layered structures occur in two phases namely the Ruddlesden-Popper phase and Dion-Jacobson phase, depending on the spacer cation types. Alternating inorganic and organic layers form multiple quantum wells naturally, along with spin-orbit-coupling gives Rashba splitting. 2D perovskite materials are coming up with interesting chemical, physical properties like exciton dynamics, charge carrier transport, and electron-phonon coupling as a result of the quantum confinement effect. Despite appreciable stability, limited charge transport and large bandgap are limiting the application of 2D perovskite materials in solar cells. These limitations can be overcome by using the concept of 2D/3D multidimensional hybrid perovskites, which includes the long-term stability of 2D perovskite and the high performance of 3D perovskite at the same time. Here in this perspective, we have given brief insight on structural versatility, synthesis techniques, some of the unique photophysical properties, potential device fabrication, and recent advancements in the 2D structure to stand against degradation. Certain shortcomings and future outlooks are also discussed to make the perspective more informative.},

   abstract = {Most short sequences can be precisely written into a selected genomic target using prime editing; however, it remains unclear what factors govern insertion. We design a library of 3,604 sequences of various lengths and measure the frequency of their insertion into four genomic sites in three human cell lines, using different prime editor systems in varying DNA repair contexts. We find that length, nucleotide composition and secondary structure of the insertion sequence all affect insertion rates. We also discover that the 3' flap nucleases TREX1 and TREX2 suppress the insertion of longer sequences. Combining the sequence and repair features into a machine learning model, we can predict relative frequency of insertions into a site with R = 0.70. Finally, we demonstrate how our accurate prediction and user-friendly software help choose codon variants of common fusion tags that insert at high efficiency, and provide a catalog of empirically determined insertion rates for over a hundred useful sequences.},

   abstract = {Transcriptome engineering applications in living cells with RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors depend on accurate prediction of on-target activity and off-target avoidance. Here we design and test ~200,000 RfxCas13d guide RNAs targeting essential genes in human cells with systematically designed mismatches and insertions and deletions (indels). We find that mismatches and indels have a position- and context-dependent impact on Cas13d activity, and mismatches that result in G-U wobble pairings are better tolerated than other single-base mismatches. Using this large-scale dataset, we train a convolutional neural network that we term targeted inhibition of gene expression via gRNA design (TIGER) to predict efficacy from guide sequence and context. TIGER outperforms the existing models at predicting on-target and off-target activity on our dataset and published datasets. We show that TIGER scoring combined with specific mismatches yields the first general framework to modulate transcript expression, enabling the use of RNA-targeting CRISPRs to precisely control gene dosage.},

   abstract = {Peptide materials have a wide array of functions, from tissue engineering and surface coatings to catalysis and sensing. Tuning the sequence of amino acids that comprise the peptide modulates peptide functionality, but a small increase in sequence length leads to a dramatic increase in the number of peptide candidates. Traditionally, peptide design is guided by human expertise and intuition and typically yields fewer than ten peptides per study, but these approaches are not easily scalable and are susceptible to human bias. Here we introduce a machine learning workflow-AI-expert-that combines Monte Carlo tree search and random forest with molecular dynamics simulations to develop a fully autonomous computational search engine to discover peptide sequences with high potential for self-assembly. We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI-expert to efficiently search large spaces of tripeptides and pentapeptides. The predictability of AI-expert performs on par or better than our human experts and suggests several non-intuitive sequences with high self-assembly propensity, outlining its potential to overcome human bias and accelerate peptide discovery.},

Such layered materials with ultrathin morphologies and extreme aspect ratios currently display a vast range of properties; however, until recently a conspicuously missing property of 2D materials was global chirality. The situation has changed over the past few years with the implementation of several distinct types of ultrathin chiral 2D crystals. Here we offer a forward-looking perspective on this field to comprehend the fundamentals of global chirality in two dimensions and develop new directions. We specifically discuss the experimental achievements of the emerging chiral 2D materials with a focus on their design strategy, synthesis, structural characterization, fundamental physical properties and possible applications. We will highlight how the molecular-scale local chirality could be significantly transmitted and amplified throughout ultrathin single-crystalline 2D structures, resulting in distinctive global chirality that brings more sophisticated functions.},

   abstract = {Semiconductor quantum-well structures and superlattices are key building blocks in modern optoelectronics, but it is difficult to simultaneously realize defect-free epitaxial growth while fine tuning the chemical composition, layer thickness and band structure of each layer to achieve the desired performance. Here we demonstrate the modulation of the electronic structure-and consequently the optical properties-of organic semiconducting building blocks that are incorporated between the layers of perovskites through a facile solution processing step. Self-aggregation of the conjugated organic molecules is suppressed by functionalization with sterically demanding groups and single crystalline organic-perovskite hybrid quantum wells (down to one-unit-cell thick) are obtained. The energy and charge transfers between adjacent organic and inorganic layers are shown to be fast and efficient, owing to the atomically flat interface and ultrasmall interlayer distance of the perovskite materials. The resulting two-dimensional hybrid perovskites are very stable due to protection given by the bulky hydrophobic organic groups.},

Using first-principles thermodynamics we examined the theoretical stability of the 400 unreported members and predict that 54 should be stable. Of those previously unreported 'missing' materials now predicted to be stable, 15 were grown in this study; X-ray studies agreed with the predicted crystal structure in all 15 cases. Among the predicted and characterized properties of the missing compounds are potential transparent conductors, thermoelectric materials and topological semimetals.

To overcome this challenge, we combine atom-in-molecule-based fragments, dubbed 'amons' (A), with active learning in transferable quantum machine learning (ML) models. The efficiency, accuracy, scalability and transferability of the resulting AML models is demonstrated for important molecular quantum properties such as energies, forces, atomic charges, NMR shifts and polarizabilities and for systems including organic molecules, 2D materials, water clusters, Watson-Crick DNA base pairs and even ubiquitin. Conceptually, the AML approach extends Mendeleev's table to account effectively for chemical environments, which allows the systematic reconstruction of many chemistries from local building blocks.

Chemists have developed theories to predict oxidation states based on electron-counting rules, but these can fail to describe oxidation states in extended crystalline systems such as metal-organic frameworks. Here we propose the use of a machine-learning model, trained on assignments by chemists encoded in the chemical names in the Cambridge Structural Database, to automatically assign oxidation states to the metal ions in metal-organic frameworks. In our approach, only the immediate local environment around a metal centre is considered. We show that the strategy is robust to experimental uncertainties such as incorrect protonation, unbound solvents or changes in bond length. This method gives good accuracy and we show that it can be used to detect incorrect assignments in the Cambridge Structural Database, illustrating how collective knowledge can be captured by machine learning and converted into a useful tool.},

   abstract = {Conjugated organic photoredox catalysts (OPCs) can promote a wide range of chemical transformations. It is challenging to predict the catalytic activities of OPCs from first principles, either by expert knowledge or by using a priori calculations, as catalyst activity depends on a complex range of interrelated properties. Organic photocatalysts and other catalyst systems have often been discovered by a mixture of design and trial and error. Here we report a two-step data-driven approach to the targeted synthesis of OPCs and the subsequent reaction optimization for metallophotocatalysis, demonstrated for decarboxylative sp(3)-sp(2) cross-coupling of amino acids with aryl halides. Our approach uses a Bayesian optimization strategy coupled with encoding of key physical properties using molecular descriptors to identify promising OPCs from a virtual library of 560 candidate molecules. This led to OPC formulations that are competitive with iridium catalysts by exploring just 2.4% of the available catalyst formulation space (107 of 4,500 possible reaction conditions).},

   abstract = {Late-stage functionalization is an economical approach to optimize the properties of drug candidates. However, the chemical complexity of drug molecules often makes late-stage diversification challenging. To address this problem, a late-stage functionalization platform based on geometric deep learning and high-throughput reaction screening was developed. Considering borylation as a critical step in late-stage functionalization, the computational model predicted reaction yields for diverse reaction conditions with a mean absolute error margin of 4-5%, while the reactivity of novel reactions with known and unknown substrates was classified with a balanced accuracy of 92% and 67%, respectively. The regioselectivity of the major products was accurately captured with a classifier F-score of 67%. When applied to 23 diverse commercial drug molecules, the platform successfully identified numerous opportunities for structural diversification. The influence of steric and electronic information on model performance was quantified, and a comprehensive simple user-friendly reaction format was introduced that proved to be a key enabler for seamlessly integrating deep learning and high-throughput experimentation for late-stage functionalization.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional organic semiconductor-incorporated perovskites are a promising family of hybrid materials for optoelectronic applications, owing in part to their inherent quantum well architecture. Tuning their structures and properties for specific properties, however, has remained challenging. Here we report a general method to tune the dimensionality of phase-pure organic semiconductor-incorporated perovskite single crystals during their synthesis, by judicious choice of solvent. The length of the conjugated semiconducting organic cations and the dimensionality (n value) of the inorganic layers can be manipulated at the same time. The energy band offsets and exciton dynamics at the organic-inorganic interfaces can therefore be precisely controlled. Furthermore, we show that longer and more planar pi-conjugated organic cations induce a more rigid inorganic crystal lattice, which leads to suppressed exciton-phonon interactions and better optoelectronic properties as compared to conventional two-dimensional perovskites. As a demonstration, optically driven lasing behaviour with substantially lower lasing thresholds was realized.},

   abstract = {There are more amino acid permutations within a 40-residue sequence than atoms on Earth. This vast chemical search space hinders the use of human learning to design functional polymers. Here we show how machine learning enables the de novo design of abiotic nuclear-targeting miniproteins to traffic antisense oligomers to the nucleus of cells. We combined high-throughput experimentation with a directed evolution-inspired deep-learning approach in which the molecular structures of natural and unnatural residues are represented as topological fingerprints. The model is able to predict activities beyond the training dataset, and simultaneously deciphers and visualizes sequence-activity predictions. The predicted miniproteins, termed 'Mach', reach an average mass of 10 kDa, are more effective than any previously known variant in cells and can also deliver proteins into the cytosol. The Mach miniproteins are non-toxic and efficiently deliver antisense cargo in mice. These results demonstrate that deep learning can decipher design principles to generate highly active biomolecules that are unlikely to be discovered by empirical approaches.},

   abstract = {Nature uses organic molecules for light harvesting and photosynthesis, but most man-made water splitting catalysts are inorganic semiconductors. Organic photocatalysts, while attractive because of their synthetic tunability, tend to have low quantum efficiencies for water splitting. Here we present a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) based on a benzo-bis(benzothiophene sulfone) moiety that shows a much higher activity for photochemical hydrogen evolution than its amorphous or semicrystalline counterparts. The COF is stable under long-term visible irradiation and shows steady photochemical hydrogen evolution with a sacrificial electron donor for at least 50 hours. We attribute the high quantum efficiency of fused-sulfone-COF to its crystallinity, its strong visible light absorption, and its wettable, hydrophilic 3.2 nm mesopores. These pores allow the framework to be dye-sensitized, leading to a further 61% enhancement in the hydrogen evolution rate up to 16.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1). The COF also retained its photocatalytic activity when cast as a thin film onto a support.},

   abstract = {Cation exchanged-zeolites are functional materials with a wide range of applications from catalysis to sorbents. They present a challenge for computational studies using density functional theory due to the numerous possible active sites. From Al configuration, to placement of extra framework cation(s), to potentially different oxidation states of the cation, accounting for all these possibilities is not trivial. To make the number of calculations more tractable, most studies focus on a few active sites. We attempt to go beyond these limitations by implementing a workflow for a high throughput screening, designed to systematize the problem and exhaustively search for feasible active sites. We use Pd-exchanged CHA and BEA to illustrate the approach. After conducting thousands of explicit DFT calculations, we identify the sites most favorable for the Pd cation and discuss the results in detail. The high throughput screening identifies many energetically favorable sites that are non-trivial. Lastly, we employ these results to examine NO adsorption in Pd-exchanged CHA, which is a promising passive NO(x) adsorbent (PNA) during the cold start of automobiles. The results shed light on critical active sites for NO(x) capture that were not previously studied.},

To identify functional coatings that can suppress this degradation, we present a high-throughput density functional theory based framework which consists of reaction models that describe thermodynamic and electrochemical stabilities, and acid-scavenging capabilities of materials. Screening more than 130,000 oxygen-bearing materials, we suggest physical and hydrofluoric-acid barrier coatings such as WO(3), LiAl(5)O(8) and ZrP(2)O(7) and hydrofluoric-acid scavengers such as Sc(2)O(3), Li(2)CaGeO(4), LiBO(2), Li(3)NbO(4), Mg(3)(BO(3))(2) and Li(2)MgSiO(4). Using a design strategy to find the thermodynamically optimal coatings for a cathode, we further present optimal hydrofluoric-acid scavengers such as Li(2)SrSiO(4), Li(2)CaSiO(4) and CaIn(2)O(4) for the layered LiCoO(2), and Li(2)GeO(3), Li(4)NiTeO(6) and Li(2)MnO(3) for the spinel LiMn(2)O(4) cathodes. These coating materials have the potential to prolong the cycle-life of Li-ion batteries and surpass the performance of common coatings based on conventional materials such as Al(2)O(3), ZnO, MgO or ZrO(2).},

   abstract = {The central goal of crystal engineering is to control material function via rational design of structure. A particularly successful realisation of this paradigm is hybrid improper ferroelectricity in layered perovskite materials, where layering and cooperative octahedral tilts combine to break inversion symmetry. However, in the parent family of inorganic ABX(3) perovskites, symmetry prevents hybrid coupling to polar distortions. Here, we use group-theoretical analysis to uncover a profound enhancement of the number of improper ferroelectric coupling schemes available to molecular perovskites. This enhancement arises because molecular substitution diversifies the range of distortions possible. Not only do our insights rationalise the emergence of polarisation in previously studied materials, but we identify the fundamental importance of molecular degrees of freedom that are straightforwardly controlled from a synthetic viewpoint. We envisage that the crystal design principles we develop here will enable targeted synthesis of a large family of new acentric functional materials.},

The stability of equimolar single-phase solid solution of five or more elements is supposedly rare and identifying the existence of such alloys has been challenging because of the vast chemical space of possible combinations. Herein, based on high-throughput density-functional theory calculations, we construct a chemical map of single-phase equimolar high-entropy alloys by investigating over 658,000 equimolar quinary alloys through a binary regular solid-solution model. We identify 30,201 potential single-phase equimolar alloys (5% of the possible combinations) forming mainly in body-centered cubic structures. We unveil the chemistries that are likely to form high-entropy alloys, and identify the complex interplay among mixing enthalpy, intermetallics formation, and melting point that drives the formation of these solid solutions. We demonstrate the power of our method by predicting the existence of two new high-entropy alloys, i.e. the body-centered cubic AlCoMnNiV and the face-centered cubic CoFeMnNiZn, which are successfully synthesized.},

   abstract = {Owing to their high energy-conversion efficiency and inexpensive fabrication routes, solar cells based on metal-organic halide perovskites have rapidly gained prominence as a disruptive technology. An attractive feature of perovskite absorbers is the possibility of tailoring their properties by changing the elemental composition through the chemical precursors. In this context, rational in silico design represents a powerful tool for mapping the vast materials landscape and accelerating discovery. Here we show that the optical band gap of metal-halide perovskites, a key design parameter for solar cells, strongly correlates with a simple structural feature, the largest metal-halide-metal bond angle. Using this descriptor we suggest continuous tunability of the optical gap from the mid-infrared to the visible. Precise band gap engineering is achieved by controlling the bond angles through the steric size of the molecular cation. On the basis of these design principles we predict novel low-gap perovskites for optimum photovoltaic efficiency, and we demonstrate the concept of band gap modulation by synthesising and characterising novel mixed-cation perovskites.},

   abstract = {The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO(3)RR) to ammonia is an essential step toward restoring the globally disrupted nitrogen cycle. In search of highly efficient electrocatalysts, tailoring catalytic sites with ligand and strain effects in random alloys is a common approach but remains limited due to the ubiquitous energy-scaling relations. With interpretable machine learning, we unravel a mechanism of breaking adsorption-energy scaling relations through the site-specific Pauli repulsion interactions of the metal d-states with adsorbate frontier orbitals. The non-scaling behavior can be realized on (100)-type sites of ordered B2 intermetallics, in which the orbital overlap between the hollow *N and subsurface metal atoms is significant while the bridge-bidentate *NO(3) is not directly affected. Among those intermetallics predicted, we synthesize monodisperse ordered B2 CuPd nanocubes that demonstrate high performance for NO(3)RR to ammonia with a Faradaic efficiency of 92.5% at -0.5 V(RHE) and a yield rate of 6.25 mol h(-1) g(-1) at -0.6 V(RHE). This study provides machine-learned design rules besides the d-band center metrics, paving the path toward data-driven discovery of catalytic materials beyond linear scaling limitations.},

   abstract = {Supramolecular synthesis is a powerful strategy for assembling complex molecules, but to do this by targeted design is challenging. This is because multicomponent assembly reactions have the potential to form a wide variety of products. High-throughput screening can explore a broad synthetic space, but this is inefficient and inelegant when applied blindly. Here we fuse computation with robotic synthesis to create a hybrid discovery workflow for discovering new organic cage molecules, and by extension, other supramolecular systems. A total of 78 precursor combinations were investigated by computation and experiment, leading to 33 cages that were formed cleanly in one-pot syntheses. Comparison of calculations with experimental outcomes across this broad library shows that computation has the power to focus experiments, for example by identifying linkers that are less likely to be reliable for cage formation. Screening also led to the unplanned discovery of a new cage topology-doubly bridged, triply interlocked cage catenanes.},

   abstract = {Electrostatic capacitors play a crucial role as energy storage devices in modern electrical systems. Energy density, the figure of merit for electrostatic capacitors, is primarily determined by the choice of dielectric material. Most industry-grade polymer dielectrics are flexible polyolefins or rigid aromatics, possessing high energy density or high thermal stability, but not both. Here, we employ artificial intelligence (AI), established polymer chemistry, and molecular engineering to discover a suite of dielectrics in the polynorbornene and polyimide families. Many of the discovered dielectrics exhibit high thermal stability and high energy density over a broad temperature range. One such dielectric displays an energy density of 8.3 J cc(-1) at 200 degrees C, a value 11 x that of any commercially available polymer dielectric at this temperature. We also evaluate pathways to further enhance the polynorbornene and polyimide families, enabling these capacitors to perform well in demanding applications (e.g., aerospace) while being environmentally sustainable. These findings expand the potential applications of electrostatic capacitors within the 85-200 degrees C temperature range, at which there is presently no good commercial solution. More broadly, this research demonstrates the impact of AI on chemical structure generation and property prediction, highlighting the potential for materials design advancement beyond electrostatic capacitors.},

In this study, a machine-learning framework is presented to optimize this layer. We featurize 21 organic halide salts, apply them as capping layers onto methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films, age them under accelerated conditions, and determine features governing stability using supervised machine learning and Shapley values. We find that organic molecules' low number of hydrogen-bonding donors and small topological polar surface area correlate with increased MAPbI3 film stability. The top performing organic halide, phenyltriethylammonium iodide (PTEAI), successfully extends the MAPbI3 stability lifetime by 4 +/- 2 times over bare MAPbI3 and 1.3 +/- 0.3 times over state-of-the-art octylammonium bromide (OABr). Through characterization, we find that this capping layer stabilizes the photoactive layer by changing the surface chemistry and suppressing methylammonium loss.},

   abstract = {Reduced-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite materials are widely applied for perovskite photovoltaics due to their remarkable environmental stability. However, their device performance still lags far behind traditional three dimensional perovskites, particularly high open circuit voltage (V(oc)) loss. Here, inhomogeneous energy landscape is pointed out to be the sole reason, which introduces extra energy loss, creates band tail states and inhibits minority carrier transport. We thus propose to form homogeneous energy landscape to overcome the problem. A synergistic approach is conceived, by taking advantage of material structure and crystallization kinetic engineering. Accordingly, with the help of density functional theory guided material design, (aminomethyl) piperidinium quasi-2D perovskites are selected. The lowest energy distribution and homogeneous energy landscape are achieved through carefully regulating their crystallization kinetics. We conclude that homogeneous energy landscape significantly reduces the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and suppresses the quasi-Fermi level splitting, which is crucial to achieve high V(oc).},

   abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), hollow cylinders of carbon, hold great promise for advanced technologies, provided their structure remains uniform throughout their length. Their growth takes place at high temperatures across a tube-catalyst interface. Structural defects formed during growth alter CNT properties. These defects are believed to form and heal at the tube-catalyst interface but an understanding of these mechanisms at the atomic-level is lacking. Here we present DeepCNT-22, a machine learning force field (MLFF) to drive molecular dynamics simulations through which we unveil the mechanisms of CNT formation, from nucleation to growth including defect formation and healing. We find the tube-catalyst interface to be highly dynamic, with large fluctuations in the chiral structure of the CNT-edge. This does not support continuous spiral growth as a general mechanism, instead, at these growth conditions, the growing tube edge exhibits significant configurational entropy. We demonstrate that defects form stochastically at the tube-catalyst interface, but under low growth rates and high temperatures, these heal before becoming incorporated in the tube wall, allowing CNTs to grow defect-free to seemingly unlimited lengths. These insights, not readily available through experiments, demonstrate the remarkable power of MLFF-driven simulations and fill long-standing gaps in our understanding of CNT growth mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Sustained drug delivery strategies have many potential benefits for treating a range of diseases, particularly chronic diseases that require treatment for years. For many chronic ocular diseases, patient adherence to eye drop dosing regimens and the need for frequent intraocular injections are significant barriers to effective disease management. Here, we utilize peptide engineering to impart melanin binding properties to peptide-drug conjugates to act as a sustained-release depot in the eye. We develop a super learning-based methodology to engineer multifunctional peptides that efficiently enter cells, bind to melanin, and have low cytotoxicity. When the lead multifunctional peptide (HR97) is conjugated to brimonidine, an intraocular pressure lowering drug that is prescribed for three times per day topical dosing, intraocular pressure reduction is observed for up to 18 days after a single intracameral injection in rabbits. Further, the cumulative intraocular pressure lowering effect increases ~17-fold compared to free brimonidine injection. Engineered multifunctional peptide-drug conjugates are a promising approach for providing sustained therapeutic delivery in the eye and beyond.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional perovskites have emerged as more intrinsically stable materials for solar cells. Chemical tuning of spacer organic cations has attracted great interest due to their additional functionalities. However, how the chemical nature of the organic cations affects the properties of two-dimensional perovskites and devices is rarely reported. Here we demonstrate that the selection of spacer cations (i.e., selective fluorination of phenethylammonium) affects the film properties of two-dimensional perovskites, leading to different device performance of two-dimensional perovskite solar cells (average n = 4). Structural analysis reveals that different packing arrangements and orientational disorder of the spacer cations result in orientational degeneracy and different formation energies, largely explaining the difference in film properties. This work provides key missing information on how spacer cations exert influence on desirable electronic properties and device performance of two-dimensional perovskites via the weak and cooperative interactions of these cations in the crystal lattice.},

   abstract = {Translation of chirality and asymmetry across structural motifs and length scales plays a fundamental role in nature, enabling unique functionalities in contexts ranging from biological systems to synthetic materials. Here, we introduce a structural chirality transfer across the organic-inorganic interface in two-dimensional hybrid perovskites using appropriate chiral organic cations. The preferred molecular configuration of the chiral spacer cations, R-(+)- or S-(-)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylammonium and their asymmetric hydrogen-bonding interactions with lead bromide-based layers cause symmetry-breaking helical distortions in the inorganic layers, otherwise absent when employing a racemic mixture of organic spacers. First-principles modeling predicts a substantial bulk Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-splitting in the inorganic-derived conduction band with opposite spin textures between R- and S-hybrids due to the broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling. The ability to break symmetry using chirality transfer from one structural unit to another provides a synthetic design paradigm for emergent properties, including Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-polarization for hybrid perovskite spintronics and related applications.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid metal halide perovskites have emerged as outstanding optoelectronic materials and are potential hosts of Rashba/Dresselhaus spin-splitting for spin-selective transport and spin-orbitronics. However, a quantitative microscopic understanding of what controls the spin-splitting magnitude is generally lacking. Through crystallographic and first-principles studies on a broad array of chiral and achiral 2D perovskites, we demonstrate that a specific bond angle disparity connected with asymmetric tilting distortions of the metal halide octahedra breaks local inversion symmetry and strongly correlates with computed spin-splitting. This distortion metric can serve as a crystallographic descriptor for rapid discovery of potential candidate materials with strong spin-splitting. Our work establishes that, rather than the global space group, local inorganic layer distortions induced via appropriate organic cations provide a key design objective to achieve strong spin-splitting in perovskites. New chiral perovskites reported here couple a sizeable spin-splitting with chiral degrees of freedom and offer a unique paradigm of potential interest for spintronics.},

Here, we make use of methanesulfonate (MeS) that can interact with the spacer BA cations via strong hydrogen bonding interaction to reconstruct the quasi-2D perovskite structure, which increases the energy acceptor-to-donor ratio and enhances the energy transfer in perovskite films, thus improving the light emission efficiency. MeS additives also lower the defect density in RP perovskites, which is due to the elimination of uncoordinated Pb(2+) by the electron-rich Lewis base MeS and the weakened adsorbate blocking effect. As a result, green light-emitting diodes fabricated using these quasi-2D RP perovskite films reach current efficiency of 63 cd A(-1) and 20.5% external quantum efficiency, which are the best reported performance for devices based on quasi-2D perovskites so far.},

Evaluating the suitability of OSC candidates on the basis of charge injection and mobility descriptors, the approach successively queries predictive-quality first-principles calculations to build a refining surrogate model. The AML approach is optimized in a truncated test space, providing deep methodological insight by visualizing it as a chemical space network. Significantly outperforming a conventional computational funnel, the optimized AML approach rapidly identifies well-known and hitherto unknown molecular OSC candidates with superior charge conduction properties. Most importantly, it constantly finds further candidates with highest efficiency while continuing its exploration of the endless design space.},

Here we report a facile yet efficient method to fabricate hierarchical chiral nanostructures over a large area (>11.7 x 11.7 cm(2)) and with high g-factors (up to 0.07 in the visible region) by imparting extrinsic chirality to nanostructured polymer substrates through the simple exertion of mechanical force. We also demonstrate the application of our approach in the polarized emission of quantum dots and information encryption, including chiral quick response codes and anti-counterfeiting. This study thus paves the way for the rational design and fabrication of large-area chiral nanostructures and for their application in quantum communications and security-enhanced optical communications.},

Successfully, six orthorhombic lead-free HOIPs with proper bandgap for solar cells and room temperature thermal stability are screened out from 5158 unexplored HOIPs and two of them stand out with direct bandgaps in the visible region and excellent environmental stability. Essentially, a close structure-property relationship mapping the HOIPs bandgap is established.

   abstract = {Useful materials must satisfy multiple objectives, where the optimization of one objective is often at the expense of another. The Pareto front reports the optimal trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. Here we use a self-driving laboratory, Ada, to define the Pareto front of conductivities and processing temperatures for palladium films formed by combustion synthesis. Ada discovers new synthesis conditions that yield metallic films at lower processing temperatures (below 200 degrees C) relative to the prior art for this technique (250 degrees C). This temperature difference makes possible the coating of different commodity plastic materials (e.g., Nafion, polyethersulfone). These combustion synthesis conditions enable us to to spray coat uniform palladium films with moderate conductivity (1.1 x 10(5) S m(-1)) at 191 degrees C. Spray coating at 226 degrees C yields films with conductivities (2.0 x 10(6) S m(-1)) comparable to those of sputtered films (2.0 to 5.8 x 10(6) S m(-1)). This work shows how a self-driving laboratoy can discover materials that provide optimal trade-offs between conflicting objectives.},

   abstract = {Catalytic-materials design requires predictive modeling of the interaction between catalyst and reactants. This is challenging due to the complexity and diversity of structure-property relationships across the chemical space. Here, we report a strategy for a rational design of catalytic materials using the artificial intelligence approach (AI) subgroup discovery. We identify catalyst genes (features) that correlate with mechanisms that trigger, facilitate, or hinder the activation of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) towards a chemical conversion. The AI model is trained on first-principles data for a broad family of oxides. We demonstrate that surfaces of experimentally identified good catalysts consistently exhibit combinations of genes resulting in a strong elongation of a C-O bond. The same combinations of genes also minimize the OCO-angle, the previously proposed indicator of activation, albeit under the constraint that the Sabatier principle is satisfied. Based on these findings, we propose a set of new promising catalyst materials for CO(2) conversion.},

   abstract = {It has long been a norm that researchers extract knowledge from literature to design materials. However, the avalanche of publications makes the norm challenging to follow. Text mining (TM) is efficient in extracting information from corpora. Still, it cannot discover materials not present in the corpora, hindering its broader applications in exploring novel materials, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Here we introduce a concept of "context similarity" for selecting chemical elements for HEAs, based on TM models that analyze the abstracts of 6.4 million papers. The method captures the similarity of chemical elements in the context used by scientists. It overcomes the limitations of TM and identifies the Cantor and Senkov HEAs. We demonstrate its screening capability for six- and seven-component lightweight HEAs by finding nearly 500 promising alloys out of 2.6 million candidates. The method thus brings an approach to the development of ultrahigh-entropy alloys and multicomponent materials.},

The state-of-the-art metal catalysts including Pt and its bimetallics with Ir show promising activity, albeit suffering from high overpotentials for appreciable current densities and the soaring price of precious metals. Herein, the immense design space of ternary Pt alloy nanostructures is explored by graph neural networks trained on ab initio data for concurrently predicting site reactivity, surface stability, and catalyst synthesizability descriptors. Among a few Ir-free candidates that emerge from the active learning workflow, Pt(3)Ru-M (M: Fe, Co, or Ni) alloys were successfully synthesized and experimentally verified to be more active toward ammonia oxidation than Pt, Pt(3)Ir, and Pt(3)Ru. More importantly, feature attribution analyses using the machine-learned representation of site motifs provide fundamental insights into chemical bonding at metal surfaces and shed light on design strategies for high-performance catalytic systems beyond the d-band center metric of binding sites.},

When information about mobility flows is not available for a particular region of interest, we must rely on mathematical models to generate them. In this work, we propose Deep Gravity, an effective model to generate flow probabilities that exploits many features (e.g., land use, road network, transport, food, health facilities) extracted from voluntary geographic data, and uses deep neural networks to discover non-linear relationships between those features and mobility flows. Our experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State, show that Deep Gravity achieves a significant increase in performance, especially in densely populated regions of interest, with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not use deep neural networks or geographic data. Deep Gravity has good generalization capability, generating realistic flows also for geographic areas for which there is no data availability for training. Finally, we show how flows generated by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features and highlight crucial differences among the three considered countries interpreting the model's prediction with explainable AI techniques.},

The new intermediate phase changes the crystallization pathway, thereby suppressing the phase-segregation. Accordingly, high-quality large-area quasi-2D films with desirable properties are obtained. Based on this, we further rationally adjusted films' recombination kinetics. We reported a series of highly-efficient green quasi-2D PeLEDs with active areas of 9.0 cm(2). The peak EQE of 16.4% is achieved in <n > = 3, represent the most efficient large-area PeLEDs yet.

In this study, we discover that effective CH(4) cracking can be achieved at 450 degrees C over a Re/Ni single-atom alloy via ball milling. To explore single-atom alloy catalysis, we construct a library of 10,950 transition metal single-atom alloy surfaces and screen candidates based on C-H dissociation energy barriers predicted by a machine learning model. Experimental validation identifies Ir/Ni and Re/Ni as top performers. Notably, the non-noble metal Re/Ni achieves a hydrogen yield of 10.7 gH(2) gcat(-1) h(-1) with 99.9% selectivity and 7.75% CH(4) conversion at 450 degrees C, 1 atm.

Improved ML models are therefore actively researched, but their design is currently guided mainly by monitoring the average model test error. This can render different models indistinguishable although their performance differs substantially across materials, or it can make a model appear generally insufficient while it actually works well in specific sub-domains. Here, we present a method, based on subgroup discovery, for detecting domains of applicability (DA) of models within a materials class. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing three state-of-the-art ML models for predicting the formation energy of transparent conducting oxides. We find that, despite having a mutually indistinguishable and unsatisfactory average error, the models have DAs with distinctive features and notably improved performance.},

Extensive data are available on those element combinations that produce synthetically isolable materials, but it is difficult to assimilate the scale of this information to guide selection from the diversity of potential new chemistries.

Consequently, we achieved efficient and stable deep-red light-emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.3% (average 22.9% among 70 devices and cross-checked) and a half-life of ~220 and 2.8 h under a constant current density of 0.1 and 12 mA/cm(2), respectively.

   abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the significant efforts in novel material discovery in the use of data-driven techniques, in particular, machine learning (ML). However, since it needs to consider the precursors, experimental conditions, and availability of reactants, material synthesis is generally much more complex than property and structure prediction, and very few computational predictions are experimentally realized. To solve these challenges, a universal framework that integrates high-throughput experiments, a priori knowledge of chemistry, and ML techniques such as subgroup discovery and support vector machine is proposed to guide the experimental synthesis of materials, which is capable of disclosing structure-property relationship hidden in high-throughput experiments and rapidly screening out materials with high synthesis feasibility from vast chemical space. Through application of our approach to challenging and consequential synthesis problem of 2D silver/bismuth organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, we have increased the success rate of the synthesis feasibility by a factor of four relative to traditional approaches. This study provides a practical route for solving multidimensional chemical acceleration problems with small dataset from typical laboratory with limited experimental resources available.},

   abstract = {The past decade has witnessed rapid progress in deep learning for molecular design, owing to the availability of invertible and invariant representations for molecules such as simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES), which has powered cheminformatics since the late 1980s. However, the design of elemental components and their structural arrangement in solid-state materials to achieve certain desired properties is still a long-standing challenge in physics, chemistry and biology. This is primarily due to, unlike molecular inverse design, the lack of an invertible crystal representation that satisfies translational, rotational, and permutational invariances. To address this issue, we have developed a simplified line-input crystal-encoding system (SLICES), which is a string-based crystal representation that satisfies both invertibility and invariances. The reconstruction routine of SLICES successfully reconstructed 94.95% of over 40,000 structurally and chemically diverse crystal structures, showcasing an unprecedented invertibility. Furthermore, by only encoding compositional and topological data, SLICES guarantees invariances. We demonstrate the application of SLICES in the inverse design of direct narrow-gap semiconductors for optoelectronic applications. As a string-based, invertible, and invariant crystal representation, SLICES shows promise as a useful tool for in silico materials discovery.},

   abstract = {Artificial chiral materials and nanostructures with strong and tuneable chiroptical activities, including sign, magnitude, and wavelength distribution, are useful owing to their potential applications in chiral sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and chiroptical devices. Thus, the inverse design and customized manufacturing of these materials is highly desirable. Here, we use an artificial intelligence (AI) guided robotic chemist to accurately predict chiroptical activities from the experimental absorption spectra and structure/process parameters, and generate chiral films with targeted chiroptical activities across the full visible spectrum. The robotic AI-chemist carries out the entire process, including chiral film construction, characterization, and testing. A machine learned reverse design model using spectrum embedded descriptors is developed to predict optimal structure/process parameters for any targeted chiroptical property. A series of chiral films with a dissymmetry factor as high as 1.9 (g(abs) ~ 1.9) are identified out of more than 100 million possible structures, and their feasible application in circular polarization-selective color filters for multiplex laser display and switchable circularly polarized (CP) luminescence is demonstrated. Our findings not only provide chiral films with the highest reported chiroptical activity, but also have great fundamental value for the inverse design of chiroptical materials.},

   abstract = {Transparent conductors combine two generally contradictory physical properties, but there are numerous applications where both functionalities are crucial. Previous searches focused on doping wide-gap metal oxides. Focusing instead on the family of 18 valence electron ternary ABX compounds that consist of elements A, B and X in 1:1:1 stoichiometry, we search theoretically for electronic structures that simultaneously lead to optical transparency while accommodating intrinsic defect structures that produce uncompensated free holes. This leads to the prediction of a stable, never before synthesized TaIrGe compound made of all-metal heavy atom compound. Laboratory synthesis then found it to be stable in the predicted crystal structure and p-type transparent conductor with a strong optical absorption peak at 3.36 eV and remarkably high hole mobility of 2,730 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at room temperature. This methodology opens the way to future searches of transparent conductors in unexpected chemical groups.},

   abstract = {Hot-carrier cooling processes of perovskite materials are typically described by a single parabolic band model that includes the effects of carrier-phonon scattering, hot phonon bottleneck, and Auger heating. However, little is known (if anything) about the cooling processes in which the spin-degenerate parabolic band splits into two spin-polarized bands, i.e., the Rashba band splitting effect. Here, we investigated the hot-carrier cooling processes for two slightly different compositions of two-dimensional Dion-Jacobson hybrid perovskites, namely, (3AMP)PbI(4) and (4AMP)PbI(4) (3AMP = 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium; 4AMP = 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium), using a combination of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. In (4AMP)PbI(4), upon Rashba band splitting, the spin-dependent scattering of hot electrons is responsible for accelerating hot-carrier cooling at longer delays. Importantly, the hot-carrier cooling of (4AMP)PbI(4) can be extended by manipulating the spin state of the hot carriers. Our findings suggest a new approach for prolonging hot-carrier cooling in hybrid perovskites, which is conducive to further improving the performance of hot-carrier-based optoelectronic and spintronic devices.},

By combining insights from theory and experiment, we describe the introduction of bifunctional ligands that are capable of making strong hydrogen bonds within the organic bilayer. We find that stronger intermolecular interactions draw charge away from the perovskite layers, and we have formulated a simple and intuitive computational descriptor, the charge separation descriptor (CSD), that accurately describes the relationship between the Pb-I-Pb angle, band gap, and in-plane charge transport with the strength of these interactions. A higher CSD value correlates to less distortion of the Pb-I-Pb angle, a reduced band gap, and higher in-plane mobility of the perovskite. These improved material properties result in improved device characteristics of the resulting solar cells.},

   abstract = {Stability of perovskite-based photovoltaics remains a topic requiring further attention. Cation engineering influences perovskite stability, with the present-day understanding of the impact of cations based on accelerated ageing tests at higher-than-operating temperatures (e.g. 140 degrees C). By coupling high-throughput experimentation with machine learning, we discover a weak correlation between high/low-temperature stability with a stability-reversal behavior. At high ageing temperatures, increasing organic cation (e.g. methylammonium) or decreasing inorganic cation (e.g. cesium) in multi-cation perovskites has detrimental impact on photo/thermal-stability; but below 100 degrees C, the impact is reversed. The underlying mechanism is revealed by calculating the kinetic activation energy in perovskite decomposition. We further identify that incorporating at least 10 mol.% MA and up to 5 mol.% Cs/Rb to maximize the device stability at device-operating temperature (<100 degrees C). We close by demonstrating the methylammonium-containing perovskite solar cells showing negligible efficiency loss compared to its initial efficiency after 1800 hours of working under illumination at 30 degrees C.},

Here, we develop HDRNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based framework to precisely predict dynamic RBP binding events under diverse cellular conditions. Our results demonstrate that HDRNet can accurately and efficiently identify binding sites, particularly for dynamic prediction, outperforming other state-of-the-art models on 261 linear RNA datasets from both eCLIP and CLIP-seq, supplemented with additional tissue data. Moreover, we conduct motif and interpretation analyses to provide fresh insights into the pathological mechanisms underlying RNA-RBP interactions from various perspectives. Our functional genomic analysis further explores the gene-human disease associations, uncovering previously uncharacterized observations for a broad range of genetic disorders.},

The M3GNet IAP was trained on the massive database of structural relaxations performed by the Materials Project over the past ten years and has broad applications in structural relaxation, dynamic simulations and property prediction of materials across diverse chemical spaces. About 1.8 million materials from a screening of 31 million hypothetical crystal structures were identified to be potentially stable against existing Materials Project crystals based on M3GNet energies. Of the top 2,000 materials with the lowest energies above the convex hull, 1,578 were verified to be stable using density functional theory calculations.

   abstract = {Low-dimensional perovskites have-in view of their high radiative recombination rates-shown great promise in achieving high luminescence brightness and colour saturation. Here we investigate the effect of electron-phonon interactions on the luminescence of single crystals of two-dimensional perovskites, showing that reducing these interactions can lead to bright blue emission in two-dimensional perovskites. Resonance Raman spectra and deformation potential analysis show that strong electron-phonon interactions result in fast non-radiative decay, and that this lowers the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Neutron scattering, solid-state NMR measurements of spin-lattice relaxation, density functional theory simulations and experimental atomic displacement measurements reveal that molecular motion is slowest, and rigidity greatest, in the brightest emitter. By varying the molecular configuration of the ligands, we show that a PLQY up to 79% and linewidth of 20 nm can be reached by controlling crystal rigidity and electron-phonon interactions. Designing crystal structures with electron-phonon interactions in mind offers a previously underexplored avenue to improve optoelectronic materials' performance.},

   abstract = {To unlock the full promise of messenger (mRNA) therapies, expanding the toolkit of lipid nanoparticles is paramount. However, a pivotal component of lipid nanoparticle development that remains a bottleneck is identifying new ionizable lipids. Here we describe an accelerated approach to discovering effective ionizable lipids for mRNA delivery that combines machine learning with advanced combinatorial chemistry tools. Starting from a simple four-component reaction platform, we create a chemically diverse library of 584 ionizable lipids. We screen the mRNA transfection potencies of lipid nanoparticles containing those lipids and use the data as a foundational dataset for training various machine learning models. We choose the best-performing model to probe an expansive virtual library of 40,000 lipids, synthesizing and experimentally evaluating the top 16 lipids flagged. We identify lipid 119-23, which outperforms established benchmark lipids in transfecting muscle and immune cells in several tissues. This approach facilitates the creation and evaluation of versatile ionizable lipid libraries, advancing the formulation of lipid nanoparticles for precise mRNA delivery.},

The development of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has progressed rapidly over the past several years, reaching high external quantum efficiencies of over 20%. In this Review, we focus on the key requirements for high-performance PeLEDs, highlight recent advances on materials and devices, and emphasize the importance of reliable characterization of PeLEDs. We discuss possible approaches to improve the performance of blue and red PeLEDs, increase the long-term operational stability and reduce toxicity hazards. We also provide an overview of the application space made possible by recent developments in high-efficiency PeLEDs.},

   abstract = {Materials modelling and design using computational quantum and classical approaches is by now well established as an essential pillar in condensed matter physics, chemistry and materials science research, in addition to experiments and analytical theories. The past few decades have witnessed tremendous advances in methodology development and applications to understand and predict the ground-state, excited-state and dynamical properties of materials, ranging from molecules to nanoscopic/mesoscopic materials to bulk and reduced-dimensional systems. This issue of Nature Materials presents four in-depth Review Articles on the field. This Perspective aims to give a brief overview of the progress, as well as provide some comments on future challenges and opportunities. We envision that increasingly powerful and versatile computational approaches, coupled with new conceptual understandings and the growth of techniques such as machine learning, will play a guiding role in the future search and discovery of materials for science and technology.},

   abstract = {New highly oxygen-active materials may enhance many energy-related technologies by enabling efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures, for example, below ~400 degrees C. Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to realize such performance but have received far less attention than vacancy-mediated conductors. Here we combine physically motivated structure and property descriptors, ab initio simulations and experiments to demonstrate an approach to discover new fast interstitial oxygen conductors. Multiple new families were found, which adopt completely different structures from known oxygen conductors. From these families, we synthesized and studied oxygen kinetics in La(4)Mn(5)Si(4)O(22+delta), a representative member of the perrierite/chevkinite family. We found that La(4)Mn(5)Si(4)O(22+delta) has higher oxygen-ion conductivity than the widely used yttria-stabilized ZrO(2), and among the highest surface oxygen exchange rates at the intermediate temperature of known materials. The fast oxygen kinetics is the result of simultaneously active interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion pathways. We propose that the essential features for forming an effective interstitial oxygen conductor are the availability of electrons and structural flexibility, enabling a sufficient accessible volume. This work provides a powerful approach for understanding and discovering new interstitial oxygen conductors.},

   abstract = {Multi-metal oxides in general and perovskite oxides in particular have attracted considerable attention as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Although numerous theoretical studies have been undertaken, the most promising perovskite-based catalysts continue to emerge from human-driven experimental campaigns rather than data-driven machine learning protocols, which are often limited by the scarcity of experimental data on which to train the models. This work promises to break this impasse by demonstrating that active learning on even small datasets-but supplemented by informative structural-characterization data and coupled with closed-loop experimentation-can yield materials of outstanding performance. The model we develop not only reproduces several non-obvious and actively studied experimental trends but also identifies a composition of a perovskite oxide electrocatalyst exhibiting an intrinsic overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)(oxide) of 391 mV, which is among the lowest known of four-metal perovskite oxides.},

   abstract = {The heat capacity of a material is a fundamental property of great practical importance. For example, in a carbon capture process, the heat required to regenerate a solid sorbent is directly related to the heat capacity of the material. However, for most materials suitable for carbon capture applications, the heat capacity is not known, and thus the standard procedure is to assume the same value for all materials. In this work, we developed a machine learning approach, trained on density functional theory simulations, to accurately predict the heat capacity of these materials, that is, zeolites, metal-organic frameworks and covalent-organic frameworks. The accuracy of our prediction is confirmed with experimental data. Finally, for a temperature swing adsorption process that captures carbon from the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant, we show that for some materials, the heat requirement is reduced by as much as a factor of two using the correct heat capacity.},

   abstract = {Exploratory synthesis in new chemical spaces is the essence of solid-state chemistry. However, uncharted chemical spaces can be difficult to navigate, especially when materials synthesis is challenging. Nitrides represent one such space, where stringent synthesis constraints have limited the exploration of this important class of functional materials. Here, we employ a suite of computational materials discovery and informatics tools to construct a large stability map of the inorganic ternary metal nitrides. Our map clusters the ternary nitrides into chemical families with distinct stability and metastability, and highlights hundreds of promising new ternary nitride spaces for experimental investigation-from which we experimentally realized seven new Zn- and Mg-based ternary nitrides. By extracting the mixed metallicity, ionicity and covalency of solid-state bonding from the density functional theory (DFT)-computed electron density, we reveal the complex interplay between chemistry, composition and electronic structure in governing large-scale stability trends in ternary nitride materials.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional conjugated polymers (2DCPs), composed of multiple strands of linear conjugated polymers with extended in-plane pi-conjugation, are emerging crystalline semiconducting polymers for organic (opto)electronics. They are represented by two-dimensional pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks, which typically suffer from poor pi-conjugation and thus low charge carrier mobilities. Here we overcome this limitation by demonstrating two semiconducting phthalocyanine-based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)-ladder-type 2DCPs (2DCP-MPc, with M = Cu or Ni), which are constructed from octaaminophthalocyaninato metal(II) and naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride by polycondensation under solvothermal conditions. The 2DCP-MPcs exhibit optical bandgaps of ~1.3 eV with highly delocalized pi-electrons. Density functional theory calculations unveil strongly dispersive energy bands with small electron-hole reduced effective masses of ~0.15m(0) for the layer-stacked 2DCP-MPcs. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals the band transport of Drude-type free carriers in 2DCP-MPcs with exceptionally high sum mobility of electrons and holes of ~970 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at room temperature, surpassing that of the reported linear conjugated polymers and 2DCPs. This work highlights the critical role of effective conjugation in enhancing the charge transport properties of 2DCPs and the great potential of high-mobility 2DCPs for future (opto)electronics.},

   abstract = {Pseudo-halide (PH) anion engineering has emerged as a surface passivation strategy of interest for perovskite-based optoelectronics; but until now, PH anions have led to insufficient defect passivation and thus to undesired deep impurity states. The size of the chemical space of PH anions (>10(6) molecules) has so far limited attempts to explore the full family of candidate molecules. We created a machine learning workflow to speed up the discovery process using full-density functional theory calculations for training the model. The physics-informed machine learning model allowed us to pinpoint promising molecules with a head group that prevents lattice distortion and anti-site defect formation, and a tail group optimized for strong attachment to the surface. We identified 15 potential bifunctional PH anions with the ability to passivate both donors and acceptors, and through experimentation, discovered that sodium thioglycolate was the most effective passivant. This strategy resulted in a power-conversion efficiency of 24.56% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.19 volts (24.04% National Renewable Energy Lab-certified quasi-steady-state) in inverted perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated devices maintained 96% of their initial power-conversion energy during 900 hours of one-sun operation at the maximum power point.},

Square moire superlattices with varying periodic lengths are clearly visualized through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Twist-angle-dependent transient photoluminescence microscopy and electrical characterizations indicate the emergence of localized bright excitons and trapped charge carriers near a twist angle of ~10 degrees . The localized excitons are accompanied by enhanced exciton emission, attributed to an increased oscillator strength by a theoretically predicted flat band.

Organic-inorganic two-dimensional halide perovskites (2DPKs) are organic and inorganic two-dimensional layers, which self-assemble in solution to form highly ordered periodic stacks. They exhibit a large compositional and structural phase space, which has led to novel and exciting physical properties. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding in the structure and physical properties of 2DPKs from the monolayers to assemblies, and present a comprehensive comparison with conventional semiconductors, thereby providing a broad understanding of low-dimensional semiconductors that feature complex organic-inorganic hetero-interfaces.},

   abstract = {Perovskite solar cells with submicrometre-thick CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) or CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3-x)Cl(x) active layers show a power conversion efficiency as high as 15%. However, compared to the best-performing device, the average efficiency was as low as 12%, with a large standard deviation (s.d.). Here, we report perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency exceeding 16% and best efficiency of 17%. This was enabled by the growth of CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) cuboids with a controlled size via a two-step spin-coating procedure. Spin-coating of a solution of CH(3)NH(3)I with different concentrations follows the spin-coating of PbI(2), and the cuboid size of CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) is found to strongly depend on the concentration of CH(3)NH(3)I. Light-harvesting efficiency and charge-carrier extraction are significantly affected by the cuboid size. Under simulated one-sun illumination, average efficiencies of 16.4% (s.d. +/- 0.35), 16.3% (s.d. +/- 0.44) and 13.5% (s.d. +/- 0.34) are obtained from solutions of CH(3)NH(3)I with concentrations of 0.038 M, 0.050 M and 0.063 M, respectively. By controlling the size of the cuboids of CH(3)NH(3)PbI(3) during their growth, we achieved the best efficiency of 17.01% with a photocurrent density of 21.64 mA cm(-2), open-circuit photovoltage of 1.056 V and fill factor of 0.741.},

   abstract = {Understanding and tailoring the physical behaviour of halide perovskites under practical environments is critical for designing efficient and durable optoelectronic devices. Here, we report that continuous light illumination leads to >1% contraction in the out-of-plane direction in two-dimensional hybrid perovskites, which is reversible and strongly dependent on the specific superlattice packing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that constant light illumination results in the accumulation of positive charges in the terminal iodine atoms, thereby enhancing the bonding character of inter-slab I-I interactions across the organic barrier and activating out-of-plane contraction. Correlated charge transport, structural and photovoltaic measurements confirm that the onset of the light-induced contraction is synchronized to a threefold increase in carrier mobility and conductivity, which is consistent with an increase in the electronic band dispersion predicted by first-principles calculations. Flux-dependent space-charge-limited current measurement reveals that light-induced interlayer contraction activates interlayer charge transport. The enhanced charge transport boosts the photovoltaic efficiency of two-dimensional perovskite solar cells up to 18.3% by increasing the device's fill factor and open-circuit voltage.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. Yet, only a few dozen 2D materials have been successfully synthesized or exfoliated. Here, we search for 2D materials that can be easily exfoliated from their parent compounds. Starting from 108,423 unique, experimentally known 3D compounds, we identify a subset of 5,619 compounds that appear layered according to robust geometric and bonding criteria. High-throughput calculations using van der Waals density functional theory, validated against experimental structural data and calculated random phase approximation binding energies, further allowed the identification of 1,825 compounds that are either easily or potentially exfoliable. In particular, the subset of 1,036 easily exfoliable cases provides novel structural prototypes and simple ternary compounds as well as a large portfolio of materials to search from for optimal properties. For a subset of 258 compounds, we explore vibrational, electronic, magnetic and topological properties, identifying 56 ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, including half-metals and half-semiconductors.},

   abstract = {Organometal halide perovskites exhibit large bulk crystal domain sizes, rare traps, excellent mobilities and carriers that are free at room temperature-properties that support their excellent performance in charge-separating devices. In devices that rely on the forward injection of electrons and holes, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), excellent mobilities contribute to the efficient capture of non-equilibrium charge carriers by rare non-radiative centres. Moreover, the lack of bound excitons weakens the competition of desired radiative (over undesired non-radiative) recombination. Here we report a perovskite mixed material comprising a series of differently quantum-size-tuned grains that funnels photoexcitations to the lowest-bandgap light-emitter in the mixture. The materials function as charge carrier concentrators, ensuring that radiative recombination successfully outcompetes trapping and hence non-radiative recombination. We use the new material to build devices that exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% and a radiance of 80 W sr(-1) m(-2). These represent the brightest and most efficient solution-processed near-infrared LEDs to date.},

   abstract = {An oracle that correctly predicts the outcome of every particle physics experiment, the products of every possible chemical reaction or the function of every protein would revolutionize science and technology. However, scientists would not be entirely satisfied because they would want to comprehend how the oracle made these predictions. This is scientific understanding, one of the main aims of science. With the increase in the available computational power and advances in artificial intelligence, a natural question arises: how can advanced computational systems, and specifically artificial intelligence, contribute to new scientific understanding or gain it autonomously? Trying to answer this question, we adopted a definition of 'scientific understanding' from the philosophy of science that enabled us to overview the scattered literature on the topic and, combined with dozens of anecdotes from scientists, map out three dimensions of computer-assisted scientific understanding. For each dimension, we review the existing state of the art and discuss future developments. We hope that this Perspective will inspire and focus research directions in this multidisciplinary emerging field.},

   abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of catalytic organic reactions is crucial for the design of new catalysts, modes of reactivity and the development of greener and more sustainable chemical processes(1-13). Kinetic analysis lies at the core of mechanistic elucidation by facilitating direct testing of mechanistic hypotheses from experimental data. Traditionally, kinetic analysis has relied on the use of initial rates(14), logarithmic plots and, more recently, visual kinetic methods(15-18), in combination with mathematical rate law derivations. However, the derivation of rate laws and their interpretation require numerous mathematical approximations and, as a result, they are prone to human error and are limited to reaction networks with only a few steps operating under steady state. Here we show that a deep neural network model can be trained to analyse ordinary kinetic data and automatically elucidate the corresponding mechanism class, without any additional user input. The model identifies a wide variety of classes of mechanism with outstanding accuracy, including mechanisms out of steady state such as those involving catalyst activation and deactivation steps, and performs excellently even when the kinetic data contain substantial error or only a few time points. Our results demonstrate that artificial-intelligence-guided mechanism classification is a powerful new tool that can streamline and automate mechanistic elucidation. We are making this model freely available to the community and we anticipate that this work will lead to further advances in the development of fully automated organic reaction discovery and development.},

   abstract = {The need for improved functionalities in extreme environments is fuelling interest in high-entropy ceramics(1-3). Except for the computational discovery of high-entropy carbides, performed with the entropy-forming-ability descriptor(4), most innovation has been slowly driven by experimental means(1-3). Hence, advancement in the field needs more theoretical contributions. Here we introduce disordered enthalpy-entropy descriptor (DEED), a descriptor that captures the balance between entropy gains and enthalpy costs, allowing the correct classification of functional synthesizability of multicomponent ceramics, regardless of chemistry and structure. To make our calculations possible, we have developed a convolutional algorithm that drastically reduces computational resources. Moreover, DEED guides the experimental discovery of new single-phase high-entropy carbonitrides and borides. This work, integrated into the AFLOW computational ecosystem, provides an array of potential new candidates, ripe for experimental discoveries.},

   abstract = {Helical spin structures are expressions of magnetically induced chirality, entangling the dipolar and magnetic orders in materials(1-4). The recent discovery of helical van der Waals multiferroics down to the ultrathin limit raises prospects of large chiral magnetoelectric correlations in two dimensions(5,6). However, the exact nature and magnitude of these couplings have remained unknown so far. Here we perform a precision measurement of the dynamical magnetoelectric coupling for an enantiopure domain in an exfoliated van der Waals multiferroic. We evaluate this interaction in resonance with a collective electromagnon mode, capturing the impact of its oscillations on the dipolar and magnetic orders of the material with a suite of ultrafast optical probes. Our data show a giant natural optical activity at terahertz frequencies, characterized by quadrature modulations between the electric polarization and magnetization components. First-principles calculations further show that these chiral couplings originate from the synergy between the non-collinear spin texture and relativistic spin-orbit interactions, resulting in substantial enhancements over lattice-mediated effects. Our findings highlight the potential for intertwined orders to enable unique functionalities in the two-dimensional limit and pave the way for the development of van der Waals magnetoelectric devices operating at terahertz speeds.},

   abstract = {Crystalline materials enable essential technologies, and their properties are determined by their structures. Crystal structure prediction can thus play a central part in the design of new functional materials(1,2). Researchers have developed efficient heuristics to identify structural minima on the potential energy surface(3-5). Although these methods can often access all configurations in principle, there is no guarantee that the lowest energy structure has been found. Here we show that the structure of a crystalline material can be predicted with energy guarantees by an algorithm that finds all the unknown atomic positions within a unit cell by combining combinatorial and continuous optimization. We encode the combinatorial task of finding the lowest energy periodic allocation of all atoms on a lattice as a mathematical optimization problem of integer programming(6,7), enabling guaranteed identification of the global optimum using well-developed algorithms. A single subsequent local minimization of the resulting atom allocations then reaches the correct structures of key inorganic materials directly, proving their energetic optimality under clear assumptions. This formulation of crystal structure prediction establishes a connection to the theory of algorithms and provides the absolute energetic status of observed or predicted materials. It provides the ground truth for heuristic or data-driven structure prediction methods and is uniquely suitable for quantum annealers(8-10), opening a path to overcome the combinatorial explosion of atomic configurations.},

   abstract = {Most chemical experiments are planned by human scientists and therefore are subject to a variety of human cognitive biases(1), heuristics(2) and social influences(3). These anthropogenic chemical reaction data are widely used to train machine-learning models(4) that are used to predict organic(5) and inorganic(6,7) syntheses. However, it is known that societal biases are encoded in datasets and are perpetuated in machine-learning models(8). Here we identify as-yet-unacknowledged anthropogenic biases in both the reagent choices and reaction conditions of chemical reaction datasets using a combination of data mining and experiments. We find that the amine choices in the reported crystal structures of hydrothermal synthesis of amine-templated metal oxides(9) follow a power-law distribution in which 17% of amine reactants occur in 79% of reported compounds, consistent with distributions in social influence models(10-12). An analysis of unpublished historical laboratory notebook records shows similarly biased distributions of reaction condition choices. By performing 548 randomly generated experiments, we demonstrate that the popularity of reactants or the choices of reaction conditions are uncorrelated to the success of the reaction. We show that randomly generated experiments better illustrate the range of parameter choices that are compatible with crystal formation. Machine-learning models that we train on a smaller randomized reaction dataset outperform models trained on larger human-selected reaction datasets, demonstrating the importance of identifying and addressing anthropogenic biases in scientific data.},

   abstract = {Recent years have seen revived interest in computer-assisted organic synthesis(1,2). The use of reaction- and neural-network algorithms that can plan multistep synthetic pathways have revolutionized this field(1,3-7), including examples leading to advanced natural products(6,7). Such methods typically operate on full, literature-derived 'substrate(s)-to-product' reaction rules and cannot be easily extended to the analysis of reaction mechanisms. Here we show that computers equipped with a comprehensive knowledge-base of mechanistic steps augmented by physical-organic chemistry rules, as well as quantum mechanical and kinetic calculations, can use a reaction-network approach to analyse the mechanisms of some of the most complex organic transformations: namely, cationic rearrangements. Such rearrangements are a cornerstone of organic chemistry textbooks and entail notable changes in the molecule's carbon skeleton(8-12). The algorithm we describe and deploy at https://HopCat.allchemy.net/ generates, within minutes, networks of possible mechanistic steps, traces plausible step sequences and calculates expected product distributions. We validate this algorithm by three sets of experiments whose analysis would probably prove challenging even to highly trained chemists: (1) predicting the outcomes of tail-to-head terpene (THT) cyclizations in which substantially different outcomes are encoded in modular precursors differing in minute structural details; (2) comparing the outcome of THT cyclizations in solution or in a supramolecular capsule; and (3) analysing complex reaction mixtures. Our results support a vision in which computers no longer just manipulate known reaction types(1-7) but will help rationalize and discover new, mechanistically complex transformations.},

   abstract = {Plastic waste poses an ecological challenge(1-3) and enzymatic degradation offers one, potentially green and scalable, route for polyesters waste recycling(4). Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) accounts for 12% of global solid waste(5), and a circular carbon economy for PET is theoretically attainable through rapid enzymatic depolymerization followed by repolymerization or conversion/valorization into other products(6-10). Application of PET hydrolases, however, has been hampered by their lack of robustness to pH and temperature ranges, slow reaction rates and inability to directly use untreated postconsumer plastics(11). Here, we use a structure-based, machine learning algorithm to engineer a robust and active PET hydrolase. Our mutant and scaffold combination (FAST-PETase: functional, active, stable and tolerant PETase) contains five mutations compared to wild-type PETase (N233K/R224Q/S121E from prediction and D186H/R280A from scaffold) and shows superior PET-hydrolytic activity relative to both wild-type and engineered alternatives(12) between 30 and 50 degrees C and a range of pH levels. We demonstrate that untreated, postconsumer-PET from 51 different thermoformed products can all be almost completely degraded by FAST-PETase in 1 week. FAST-PETase can also depolymerize untreated, amorphous portions of a commercial water bottle and an entire thermally pretreated water bottle at 50 masculineC. Finally, we demonstrate a closed-loop PET recycling process by using FAST-PETase and resynthesizing PET from the recovered monomers. Collectively, our results demonstrate a viable route for enzymatic plastic recycling at the industrial scale.},

   abstract = {Novel functional materials enable fundamental breakthroughs across technological applications from clean energy to information processing(1-11). From microchips to batteries and photovoltaics, discovery of inorganic crystals has been bottlenecked by expensive trial-and-error approaches. Concurrently, deep-learning models for language, vision and biology have showcased emergent predictive capabilities with increasing data and computation(12-14). Here we show that graph networks trained at scale can reach unprecedented levels of generalization, improving the efficiency of materials discovery by an order of magnitude. Building on 48,000 stable crystals identified in continuing studies(15-17), improved efficiency enables the discovery of 2.2 million structures below the current convex hull, many of which escaped previous human chemical intuition. Our work represents an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity. Stable discoveries that are on the final convex hull will be made available to screen for technological applications, as we demonstrate for layered materials and solid-electrolyte candidates. Of the stable structures, 736 have already been independently experimentally realized. The scale and diversity of hundreds of millions of first-principles calculations also unlock modelling capabilities for downstream applications, leading in particular to highly accurate and robust learned interatomic potentials that can be used in condensed-phase molecular-dynamics simulations and high-fidelity zero-shot prediction of ionic conductivity.},

   abstract = {Training algorithms to computationally plan multistep organic syntheses has been a challenge for more than 50 years(1-7). However, the field has progressed greatly since the development of early programs such as LHASA(1,7), for which reaction choices at each step were made by human operators. Multiple software platforms(6,8-14) are now capable of completely autonomous planning. But these programs 'think' only one step at a time and have so far been limited to relatively simple targets, the syntheses of which could arguably be designed by human chemists within minutes, without the help of a computer. Furthermore, no algorithm has yet been able to design plausible routes to complex natural products, for which much more far-sighted, multistep planning is necessary(15,16) and closely related literature precedents cannot be relied on. Here we demonstrate that such computational synthesis planning is possible, provided that the program's knowledge of organic chemistry and data-based artificial intelligence routines are augmented with causal relationships(17,18), allowing it to 'strategize' over multiple synthetic steps. Using a Turing-like test administered to synthesis experts, we show that the routes designed by such a program are largely indistinguishable from those designed by humans. We also successfully validated three computer-designed syntheses of natural products in the laboratory. Taken together, these results indicate that expert-level automated synthetic planning is feasible, pending continued improvements to the reaction knowledge base and further code optimization.},

   abstract = {In perovskite solar cells, the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transporting layers contain high concentrations of defects (about 100 times that within the perovskite layer), specifically, deep-level defects, which substantially reduce the power conversion efficiency of the devices(1-3). Recent efforts to reduce these interfacial defects have focused mainly on surface passivation(4-6). However, passivating the perovskite surface that interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult, because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film. Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a coherent interface could be formed between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the formation of an interlayer between a SnO(2) electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by coupling Cl-bonded SnO(2) with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features, which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers.},

   abstract = {Perovskites with low ionic radii metal centres (for example, Ge perovskites) experience both geometrical constraints and a gain in electronic energy through distortion; for these reasons, synthetic attempts do not lead to octahedral [GeI(6)] perovskites, but rather, these crystallize into polar non-perovskite structures(1-6). Here, inspired by the principles of supramolecular synthons(7,8), we report the assembly of an organic scaffold within perovskite structures with the goal of influencing the geometric arrangement and electronic configuration of the crystal, resulting in the suppression of the lone pair expression of Ge and templating the symmetric octahedra. We find that, to produce extended homomeric non-covalent bonding, the organic motif needs to possess self-complementary properties implemented using distinct donor and acceptor sites. Compared with the non-perovskite structure, the resulting [GeI(6)](4-) octahedra exhibit a direct bandgap with significant redshift (more than 0.5 eV, measured experimentally), 10 times lower octahedral distortion (inferred from measured single-crystal X-ray diffraction data) and 10 times higher electron and hole mobility (estimated by density functional theory). We show that the principle of this design is not limited to two-dimensional Ge perovskites; we implement it in the case of copper perovskite (also a low-radius metal centre), and we extend it to quasi-two-dimensional systems. We report photodiodes with Ge perovskites that outperform their non-octahedral and lead analogues. The construction of secondary sublattices that interlock with an inorganic framework within a crystal offers a new synthetic tool for templating hybrid lattices with controlled distortion and orbital arrangement, overcoming limitations in conventional perovskites.},

   abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are useful synthetic materials that are built by the programmed assembly of metal nodes and organic linkers(1). The success of MOFs results from the isoreticular principle(2), which allows families of structurally analogous frameworks to be built in a predictable way. This relies on directional coordinate covalent bonding to define the framework geometry. However, isoreticular strategies do not translate to other common crystalline solids, such as organic salts(3-5), in which the intermolecular ionic bonding is less directional. Here we show that chemical knowledge can be combined with computational crystal-structure prediction(6) (CSP) to design porous organic ammonium halide salts that contain no metals. The nodes in these salt frameworks are tightly packed ionic clusters that direct the materials to crystallize in specific ways, as demonstrated by the presence of well-defined spikes of low-energy, low-density isoreticular structures on the predicted lattice energy landscapes(7,8). These energy landscapes allow us to select combinations of cations and anions that will form thermodynamically stable, porous salt frameworks with channel sizes, functionalities and geometries that can be predicted a priori. Some of these porous salts adsorb molecular guests such as iodine in quantities that exceed those of most MOFs, and this could be useful for applications such as radio-iodine capture(9-12). More generally, the synthesis of these salts is scalable, involving simple acid-base neutralization, and the strategy makes it possible to create a family of non-metal organic frameworks that combine high ionic charge density with permanent porosity.},

   abstract = {Organic-inorganic lead halide quasi-two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are promising gain media for lasing applications because of their low cost, tunable colour, excellent stability and solution processability(1-3). Optically pumped continuous-wave (CW) lasing is highly desired for practical applications in high-density integrated optoelectronics devices and constitutes a key step towards electrically pumped lasers(4-6). However, CW lasing has not yet been realized at room temperature because of the 'lasing death' phenomenon (the abrupt termination of lasing under CW optical pumping), the cause of which remains unknown. Here we study lead halide-based quasi-2D perovskite films with different organic cations and observe that long-lived triplet excitons considerably impede population inversion during amplified spontaneous emission and optically pumped pulsed and CW lasing. Our results indicate that singlet-triplet exciton annihilation is a possible intrinsic mechanism causing lasing death. By using a distributed-feedback cavity with a high quality factor and applying triplet management strategies, we achieve stable green quasi-2D perovskite lasers under CW optical pumping in air at room temperature. We expect that our findings will pave the way to the realization of future current-injection perovskite lasers.},

   abstract = {Inorganic-organic hybrid materials such as organically templated metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and organohalide perovskites have been studied for decades, and hydrothermal and (non-aqueous) solvothermal syntheses have produced thousands of new materials that collectively contain nearly all the metals in the periodic table. Nevertheless, the formation of these compounds is not fully understood, and development of new compounds relies primarily on exploratory syntheses. Simulation- and data-driven approaches (promoted by efforts such as the Materials Genome Initiative) provide an alternative to experimental trial-and-error. Three major strategies are: simulation-based predictions of physical properties (for example, charge mobility, photovoltaic properties, gas adsorption capacity or lithium-ion intercalation) to identify promising target candidates for synthetic efforts; determination of the structure-property relationship from large bodies of experimental data, enabled by integration with high-throughput synthesis and measurement tools; and clustering on the basis of similar crystallographic structure (for example, zeolite structure classification or gas adsorption properties). Here we demonstrate an alternative approach that uses machine-learning algorithms trained on reaction data to predict reaction outcomes for the crystallization of templated vanadium selenites. We used information on 'dark' reactions--failed or unsuccessful hydrothermal syntheses--collected from archived laboratory notebooks from our laboratory, and added physicochemical property descriptions to the raw notebook information using cheminformatics techniques. We used the resulting data to train a machine-learning model to predict reaction success. When carrying out hydrothermal synthesis experiments using previously untested, commercially available organic building blocks, our machine-learning model outperformed traditional human strategies, and successfully predicted conditions for new organically templated inorganic product formation with a success rate of 89 per cent. Inverting the machine-learning model reveals new hypotheses regarding the conditions for successful product formation.},

   abstract = {Structure-based virtual ligand screening is emerging as a key paradigm for early drug discovery owing to the availability of high-resolution target structures(1-4) and ultra-large libraries of virtual compounds(5,6). However, to keep pace with the rapid growth of virtual libraries, such as readily available for synthesis (REAL) combinatorial libraries(7), new approaches to compound screening are needed(8,9). Here we introduce a modular synthon-based approach-V-SYNTHES-to perform hierarchical structure-based screening of a REAL Space library of more than 11 billion compounds. V-SYNTHES first identifies the best scaffold-synthon combinations as seeds suitable for further growth, and then iteratively elaborates these seeds to select complete molecules with the best docking scores. This hierarchical combinatorial approach enables the rapid detection of the best-scoring compounds in the gigascale chemical space while performing docking of only a small fraction (<0.1%) of the library compounds. Chemical synthesis and experimental testing of novel cannabinoid antagonists predicted by V-SYNTHES demonstrated a 33% hit rate, including 14 submicromolar ligands, substantially improving over a standard virtual screening of the Enamine REAL diversity subset, which required approximately 100 times more computational resources. Synthesis of selected analogues of the best hits further improved potencies and affinities (best inhibitory constant (K(i)) = 0.9 nM) and CB(2)/CB(1) selectivity (50-200-fold). V-SYNTHES was also tested on a kinase target, ROCK1, further supporting its use for lead discovery. The approach is easily scalable for the rapid growth of combinatorial libraries and potentially adaptable to any docking algorithm.},

   abstract = {Computer-aided drug discovery has been around for decades, although the past few years have seen a tectonic shift towards embracing computational technologies in both academia and pharma. This shift is largely defined by the flood of data on ligand properties and binding to therapeutic targets and their 3D structures, abundant computing capacities and the advent of on-demand virtual libraries of drug-like small molecules in their billions. Taking full advantage of these resources requires fast computational methods for effective ligand screening. This includes structure-based virtual screening of gigascale chemical spaces, further facilitated by fast iterative screening approaches. Highly synergistic are developments in deep learning predictions of ligand properties and target activities in lieu of receptor structure. Here we review recent advances in ligand discovery technologies, their potential for reshaping the whole process of drug discovery and development, as well as the challenges they encounter. We also discuss how the rapid identification of highly diverse, potent, target-selective and drug-like ligands to protein targets can democratize the drug discovery process, presenting new opportunities for the cost-effective development of safer and more effective small-molecule treatments.},

   abstract = {Epitaxial heterostructures based on oxide perovskites and III-V, II-VI and transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors form the foundation of modern electronics and optoelectronics(1-7). Halide perovskites-an emerging family of tunable semiconductors with desirable properties-are attractive for applications such as solution-processed solar cells, light-emitting diodes, detectors and lasers(8-15). Their inherently soft crystal lattice allows greater tolerance to lattice mismatch, making them promising for heterostructure formation and semiconductor integration(16,17). Atomically sharp epitaxial interfaces are necessary to improve performance and for device miniaturization. However, epitaxial growth of atomically sharp heterostructures of halide perovskites has not yet been achieved, owing to their high intrinsic ion mobility, which leads to interdiffusion and large junction widths(18-21), and owing to their poor chemical stability, which leads to decomposition of prior layers during the fabrication of subsequent layers. Therefore, understanding the origins of this instability and identifying effective approaches to suppress ion diffusion are of great importance(22-26). Here we report an effective strategy to substantially inhibit in-plane ion diffusion in two-dimensional halide perovskites by incorporating rigid pi-conjugated organic ligands. We demonstrate highly stable and tunable lateral epitaxial heterostructures, multiheterostructures and superlattices. Near-atomically sharp interfaces and epitaxial growth are revealed by low-dose aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the reduced heterostructure disorder and larger vacancy formation energies of the two-dimensional perovskites in the presence of conjugated ligands. These findings provide insights into the immobilization and stabilization of halide perovskite semiconductors and demonstrate a materials platform for complex and molecularly thin superlattices, devices and integrated circuits.},

   abstract = {Control of the spin angular momentum (SAM) carried in a photon provides a technologically attractive element for next-generation quantum networks and spintronics(1-5). However, the weak optical activity and inhomogeneity of thin films from chiral molecular crystals result in high noise and uncertainty in SAM detection. Brittleness of thin molecular crystals represents a further problem for device integration and practical realization of chiroptical quantum devices(6-10). Despite considerable successes with highly dissymmetric optical materials based on chiral nanostructures(11-13), the problem of integration of nanochiral materials with optical device platforms remains acute(14-16). Here we report a simple yet powerful method to fabricate chiroptical flexible layers via supramolecular helical ordering of conjugated polymer chains. Their multiscale chirality and optical activity can be varied across the broad spectral range by chiral templating with volatile enantiomers. After template removal, chromophores remain stacked in one-dimensional helical nanofibrils producing a homogeneous chiroptical layer with drastically enhanced polarization-dependent absorbance, leading to well-resolved detection and visualization of SAM. This study provides a direct path to scalable realization of on-chip detection of the spin degree of freedom of photons necessary for encoded quantum information processing and high-resolution polarization imaging.},

Over 17 days of continuous operation, the A-Lab realized 41 novel compounds from a set of 58 targets including a variety of oxides and phosphates that were identified using large-scale ab initio phase-stability data from the Materials Project and Google DeepMind. Synthesis recipes were proposed by natural-language models trained on the literature and optimized using an active-learning approach grounded in thermodynamics. Analysis of the failed syntheses provides direct and actionable suggestions to improve current techniques for materials screening and synthesis design. The high success rate demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-driven platforms for autonomous materials discovery and motivates further integration of computations, historical knowledge and robotics.},

   abstract = {Conducting polymers (CPs) with high conductivity and solution processability have made great advances since the pioneering work on doped polyacetylene(1-3), thus creating the new field of 'organic synthetic metals,(4). Various high-performance CPs have been realized, which enable the applications of several organic electronic devices(5,6). Nevertheless, most CPs exhibit hole-dominant (p-type) transport behaviour(7,8), whereas the development of n-type analogues lags far behind and only a few exhibit metallic state, typically limited by low doping efficiency and ambient instability. Here we present a facilely synthesized highly conductive n-type polymer poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO). The reaction combines oxidative polymerization and in situ reductive n-doping, greatly increasing the doping efficiency, and a doping level of almost 0.9 charges per repeating unit can be achieved. The resultant polymer exhibits a breakthrough conductivity of more than 2,000 S cm(-1) with excellent stability and an unexpected solution processability without extra side chains or surfactants. Furthermore, detailed investigations on PBFDO show coherent charge-transport properties and existence of metallic state. The benchmark performances in electrochemical transistors and thermoelectric generators are further demonstrated, thus paving the way for application of the n-type CPs in organic electronics.},

   abstract = {Three-dimensional organic-inorganic perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising thin-film solar cell materials owing to their remarkable photophysical properties, which have led to power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20 per cent, with the prospect of further improvements towards the Shockley-Queisser limit for a single-junction solar cell (33.5 per cent). Besides efficiency, another critical factor for photovoltaics and other optoelectronic applications is environmental stability and photostability under operating conditions. In contrast to their three-dimensional counterparts, Ruddlesden-Popper phases--layered two-dimensional perovskite films--have shown promising stability, but poor efficiency at only 4.73 per cent. This relatively poor efficiency is attributed to the inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the organic cations, which act like insulating spacing layers between the conducting inorganic slabs. Here we overcome this issue in layered perovskites by producing thin films of near-single-crystalline quality, in which the crystallographic planes of the inorganic perovskite component have a strongly preferential out-of-plane alignment with respect to the contacts in planar solar cells to facilitate efficient charge transport. We report a photovoltaic efficiency of 12.52 per cent with no hysteresis, and the devices exhibit greatly improved stability in comparison to their three-dimensional counterparts when subjected to light, humidity and heat stress tests. Unencapsulated two-dimensional perovskite devices retain over 60 per cent of their efficiency for over 2,250 hours under constant, standard (AM1.5G) illumination, and exhibit greater tolerance to 65 per cent relative humidity than do three-dimensional equivalents. When the devices are encapsulated, the layered devices do not show any degradation under constant AM1.5G illumination or humidity. We anticipate that these results will lead to the growth of single-crystalline, solution-processed, layered, hybrid, perovskite thin films, which are essential for high-performance opto-electronic devices with technologically relevant long-term stability.},

   abstract = {Chiral superconductors, a unique class of unconventional superconductors in which the complex superconducting order parameter winds clockwise or anticlockwise in the momentum space(1), represent a topologically non-trivial system with intrinsic time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) and direct implications for topological quantum computing(2,3). Intrinsic chiral superconductors are extremely rare, with only a few arguable examples, including UTe(2), UPt(3) and Sr(2)RuO(4) (refs. (4-7)). It has been suggested that chiral superconductivity may exist in non-centrosymmetric superconductors(8,9), although such non-centrosymmetry is uncommon in typical solid-state superconductors. Alternatively, chiral molecules with neither mirror nor inversion symmetry have been widely investigated. We suggest that an incorporation of chiral molecules into conventional superconductor lattices could introduce non-centrosymmetry and help realize chiral superconductivity(10). Here we explore unconventional superconductivity in chiral molecule intercalated TaS(2) hybrid superlattices. Our studies reveal an exceptionally large in-plane upper critical field B(c2,||) well beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit, a robust pi-phase shift in Little-Parks measurements and a field-free superconducting diode effect (SDE). These experimental signatures of unconventional superconductivity suggest that the intriguing interplay between crystalline atomic layers and the self-assembled chiral molecular layers may lead to exotic topological materials. Our study highlights that the hybrid superlattices could lay a versatile path to artificial quantum materials by combining a vast library of layered crystals of rich physical properties with the nearly infinite variations of molecules of designable structural motifs and functional groups(11).},

   abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly integrated into scientific discovery to augment and accelerate research, helping scientists to generate hypotheses, design experiments, collect and interpret large datasets, and gain insights that might not have been possible using traditional scientific methods alone. Here we examine breakthroughs over the past decade that include self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, and geometric deep learning, which leverages knowledge about the structure of scientific data to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI toolsneed a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.},

   abstract = {Intermolecular distance largely determines the optoelectronic properties of organic matter. Conventional organic luminescent molecules are commonly used either as aggregates or as single molecules that are diluted in a foreigner matrix. They have garnered great research interest in recent decades for a variety of applications, including light-emitting diodes(1,2), lasers(3-5) and quantum technologies(6,7), among others(8-10). However, there is still a knowledge gap on how these molecules behave between the aggregation and dilution states. Here we report an unprecedented phase of molecular aggregate that forms in a two-dimensional hybrid perovskite superlattice with a near-equilibrium distance, which we refer to as a single-molecule-like aggregate (SMA). By implementing two-dimensional superlattices, the organic emitters are held in proximity, but, surprisingly, remain electronically isolated, thereby resulting in a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, akin to that of single molecules. Moreover, the emitters within the perovskite superlattices demonstrate strong alignment and dense packing resembling aggregates, allowing for the observation of robust directional emission, substantially enhanced radiative recombination and efficient lasing. Molecular dynamics simulations together with single-crystal structure analysis emphasize the critical role of the internal rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecules in the two-dimensional lattice for creating the exclusive SMA phase. This two-dimensional superlattice unifies the paradoxical properties of single molecules and aggregates, thus offering exciting possibilities for advanced spectroscopic and photonic applications.},

   abstract = {As the chemical industry continues to produce considerable quantities of waste chemicals(1,2), it is essential to devise 'circular chemistry'(3-8) schemes to productively back-convert at least a portion of these unwanted materials into useful products. Despite substantial progress in the degradation of some classes of harmful chemicals(9), work on 'closing the circle'-transforming waste substrates into valuable products-remains fragmented and focused on well known areas(10-15). Comprehensive analyses of which valuable products are synthesizable from diverse chemical wastes are difficult because even small sets of waste substrates can, within few steps, generate millions of putative products, each synthesizable by multiple routes forming densely connected networks. Tracing all such syntheses and selecting those that also meet criteria of process and 'green' chemistries is, arguably, beyond the cognition of human chemists. Here we show how computers equipped with broad synthetic knowledge can help address this challenge. Using the forward-synthesis Allchemy platform(16), we generate giant synthetic networks emanating from approximately 200 waste chemicals recycled on commercial scales, retrieve from these networks tens of thousands of routes leading to approximately 300 important drugs and agrochemicals, and algorithmically rank these syntheses according to the accepted metrics of sustainable chemistry(17-19). Several of these routes we validate by experiment, including an industrially realistic demonstration on a 'pharmacy on demand' flow-chemistry platform(20). Wide adoption of computerized waste-to-valuable algorithms can accelerate productive reuse of chemicals that would otherwise incur storage or disposal costs, or even pose environmental hazards.},

   abstract = {The discovery of novel structural classes of antibiotics is urgently needed to address the ongoing antibiotic resistance crisis(1-9). Deep learning approaches have aided in exploring chemical spaces(1,10-15); these typically use black box models and do not provide chemical insights. Here we reasoned that the chemical substructures associated with antibiotic activity learned by neural network models can be identified and used to predict structural classes of antibiotics. We tested this hypothesis by developing an explainable, substructure-based approach for the efficient, deep learning-guided exploration of chemical spaces. We determined the antibiotic activities and human cell cytotoxicity profiles of 39,312 compounds and applied ensembles of graph neural networks to predict antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity for 12,076,365 compounds. Using explainable graph algorithms, we identified substructure-based rationales for compounds with high predicted antibiotic activity and low predicted cytotoxicity. We empirically tested 283 compounds and found that compounds exhibiting antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus were enriched in putative structural classes arising from rationales. Of these structural classes of compounds, one is selective against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, evades substantial resistance, and reduces bacterial titres in mouse models of MRSA skin and systemic thigh infection. Our approach enables the deep learning-guided discovery of structural classes of antibiotics and demonstrates that machine learning models in drug discovery can be explainable, providing insights into the chemical substructures that underlie selective antibiotic activity.},

   abstract = {The mammalian brain consists of millions to billions of cells that are organized into many cell types with specific spatial distribution patterns and structural and functional properties(1-3). Here we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell-type atlas was created by combining a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of around 7 million cells profiled (approximately 4.0 million cells passing quality control), and a spatial transcriptomic dataset of approximately 4.3 million cells using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH). The atlas is hierarchically organized into 4 nested levels of classification: 34 classes, 338 subclasses, 1,201 supertypes and 5,322 clusters. We present an online platform, Allen Brain Cell Atlas, to visualize the mouse whole-brain cell-type atlas along with the single-cell RNA-sequencing and MERFISH datasets. We systematically analysed the neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell-type organization in different brain regions-in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain. The dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. Our study also uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell-type classification and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole mouse brain transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for integrative investigations of cellular and circuit function, development and evolution of the mammalian brain.},

   abstract = {Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are an emerging photovoltaic technology with the potential to disrupt the mature silicon solar cell market. Great improvements in device performance over the past few years, thanks to the development of fabrication protocols(1-3), chemical compositions(4,5) and phase stabilization methods(6-10), have made PSCs one of the most efficient and low-cost solution-processable photovoltaic technologies. However, the light-harvesting performance of these devices is still limited by excessive charge carrier recombination. Despite much effort, the performance of the best-performing PSCs is capped by relatively low fill factors and high open-circuit voltage deficits (the radiative open-circuit voltage limit minus the high open-circuit voltage)(11). Improvements in charge carrier management, which is closely tied to the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, thus provide a path towards increasing the device performance of PSCs, and reaching their theoretical efficiency limit(12). Here we report a holistic approach to improving the performance of PSCs through enhanced charge carrier management. First, we develop an electron transport layer with an ideal film coverage, thickness and composition by tuning the chemical bath deposition of tin dioxide (SnO(2)). Second, we decouple the passivation strategy between the bulk and the interface, leading to improved properties, while minimizing the bandgap penalty. In forward bias, our devices exhibit an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of up to 17.2 per cent and an electroluminescence energy conversion efficiency of up to 21.6 per cent. As solar cells, they achieve a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.2 per cent, corresponding to 80.5 per cent of the thermodynamic limit of its bandgap.},

   abstract = {The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in driving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and carbon capture(1-3). Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design by directly generating novel materials given desired property constraints, but current methods have low success rate in proposing stable crystals or can only satisfy a limited set of property constraints (4-11). Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared to prior generative models (4,12), structures produced by MatterGen are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 10 times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20 % of our target. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a foundational generative model for materials design.},

   abstract = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are distinguished from other organic polymers by their crystallinity(1-3), but it remains challenging to obtain robust, highly crystalline COFs because the framework-forming reactions are poorly reversible(4,5). More reversible chemistry can improve crystallinity(6-9), but this typically yields COFs with poor physicochemical stability and limited application scope(5). Here we report a general and scalable protocol to prepare robust, highly crystalline imine COFs, based on an unexpected framework reconstruction. In contrast to standard approaches in which monomers are initially randomly aligned, our method involves the pre-organization of monomers using a reversible and removable covalent tether, followed by confined polymerization. This reconstruction route produces reconstructed COFs with greatly enhanced crystallinity and much higher porosity by means of a simple vacuum-free synthetic procedure. The increased crystallinity in the reconstructed COFs improves charge carrier transport, leading to sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates of up to 27.98 mmol h(-1) g(-1). This nanoconfinement-assisted reconstruction strategy is a step towards programming function in organic materials through atomistic structural control.},

   abstract = {The rapid increase in global energy demand and the need to replace carbon dioxide (CO(2))-emitting fossil fuels with renewable sources have driven interest in chemical storage of intermittent solar and wind energy(1,2). Particularly attractive is the electrochemical reduction of CO(2) to chemical feedstocks, which uses both CO(2) and renewable energy(3-8). Copper has been the predominant electrocatalyst for this reaction when aiming for more valuable multi-carbon products(9-16), and process improvements have been particularly notable when targeting ethylene. However, the energy efficiency and productivity (current density) achieved so far still fall below the values required to produce ethylene at cost-competitive prices. Here we describe Cu-Al electrocatalysts, identified using density functional theory calculations in combination with active machine learning, that efficiently reduce CO(2) to ethylene with the highest Faradaic efficiency reported so far. This Faradaic efficiency of over 80 per cent (compared to about 66 per cent for pure Cu) is achieved at a current density of 400 milliamperes per square centimetre (at 1.5 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) and a cathodic-side (half-cell) ethylene power conversion efficiency of 55 +/- 2 per cent at 150 milliamperes per square centimetre. We perform computational studies that suggest that the Cu-Al alloys provide multiple sites and surface orientations with near-optimal CO binding for both efficient and selective CO(2) reduction(17). Furthermore, in situ X-ray absorption measurements reveal that Cu and Al enable a favourable Cu coordination environment that enhances C-C dimerization. These findings illustrate the value of computation and machine learning in guiding the experimental exploration of multi-metallic systems that go beyond the limitations of conventional single-metal electrocatalysts.},

   abstract = {Organic semiconductors are solution-processable, lightweight and flexible and are increasingly being used as the active layer in a wide range of new technologies. The versatility of synthetic organic chemistry enables the materials to be tuned such that they can be incorporated into biological sensors, wearable electronics, photovoltaics and flexible displays. These devices can be improved by improving their material components, not only by developing the synthetic chemistry but also by improving the analytical and computational techniques that enable us to understand the factors that govern material properties. Judicious molecular design provides control of the semiconductor frontier molecular orbital energy distribution and guides the hierarchical assembly of organic semiconductors into functional films where we can manipulate the properties and motion of charges and excited states. This Review describes how molecular design plays an integral role in developing organic semiconductors for electronic devices in present and emerging technologies.},

   abstract = {Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is a critical global challenge; it demands advances - at the materials, devices and systems levels - for the efficient harvesting, storage, conversion and management of renewable energy. Energy researchers have begun to incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to accelerate these advances. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances in ML-driven energy research, outline current and future challenges, and describe what is required to make the best use of ML techniques. We introduce a set of key performance indicators with which to compare the benefits of different ML-accelerated workflows for energy research. We discuss and evaluate the latest advances in applying ML to the development of energy harvesting (photovoltaics), storage (batteries), conversion (electrocatalysis) and management (smart grids). Finally, we offer an overview of potential research areas in the energy field that stand to benefit further from the application of ML.},

   abstract = {The ever-increasing number of materials science articles makes it hard to infer chemistry-structure-property relations from literature. We used natural language processing methods to automatically extract material property data from the abstracts of polymer literature. As a component of our pipeline, we trained MaterialsBERT, a language model, using 2.4 million materials science abstracts, which outperforms other baseline models in three out of five named entity recognition datasets. Using this pipeline, we obtained ~300,000 material property records from ~130,000 abstracts in 60 hours. The extracted data was analyzed for a diverse range of applications such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, and polymer solar cells to recover non-trivial insights. The data extracted through our pipeline is made available at polymerscholar.org which can be used to locate material property data recorded in abstracts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of an automatic pipeline that starts from published literature and ends with extracted material property information.},

   abstract = {Aromaticity is a central and ubiquitous concept in organic chemistry, and is used extensively to explain various phenomena. Yet, aromaticity cannot be observed or measured as a property in its own right and, to date, only qualitative and semi-quantitative relationships have been described between aromaticity and an observable property. We now demonstrate for the first time a robust quantitative relationship between the HOMO-LUMO gap and adiabatic ionization potential of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oligomer - both measurable physical quantities - and its aromaticity, as quantified by the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) index. The agreement found for a range of structurally and electronically diverse oligomeric systems of varying lengths is so well-behaved as to enable accurate prediction of the properties of longer members of the respective oligomer family. The established correlation allows for preliminary screening of compounds geared towards functional use.},

Additionally, a qualitative comparison is made between EDDB and the magnetically induced ring-current density maps from the ipsocentric approach for a series of linear acenes. Special emphasis is given to the comparative study of the description of cyclic delocalization of electrons in a wide range of organic aromatics in terms of the kekulean multicenter index KMCI and the newly proposed EDDB(k) index.},

Our first-principles predictions, based on large-scale hybrid density-functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, show that the interface between the organic and inorganic parts within a single hybrid can be modulated systematically, enabling us to select between different type-I and type-II energy level alignments. Energy levels, recombination properties, and transport behavior of electrons and holes thus become tunable by choosing specific organic functionalizations and juxtaposing them with suitable inorganic components.},

   abstract = {The theory of symmetry indicators has enabled database searches for topological materials in normal conducting phases, which has led to several encyclopedic topological material databases. To date, such a database for topological superconductors is yet to be achieved because of the lack of information about pairing symmetries of realistic materials. In this Letter, sidestepping this issue, we tackle an alternative problem: the predictions of topological and nodal superconductivity in materials for each single-valued representation of point groups. Based on recently developed symmetry indicators for superconductors, we provide comprehensive mappings from pairing symmetries to the topological or nodal superconducting nature for nonmagnetic materials listed in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. We quantitatively show that around 90% of computed materials are topological or nodal superconductors when a pairing that belongs to a one-dimensional nontrivial representation of point groups is assumed. When materials are representation-enforced nodal superconductors, positions and shapes of the nodes are also identified. When combined with experiments, our results will help us understand the pairing mechanism and facilitate realizations of the long-sought Majorana fermions promising for topological quantum computations.},

   abstract = {The use of machine learning methods for accelerating the design of crystalline materials usually requires manually constructed feature vectors or complex transformation of atom coordinates to input the crystal structure, which either constrains the model to certain crystal types or makes it difficult to provide chemical insights. Here, we develop a crystal graph convolutional neural networks framework to directly learn material properties from the connection of atoms in the crystal, providing a universal and interpretable representation of crystalline materials. Our method provides a highly accurate prediction of density functional theory calculated properties for eight different properties of crystals with various structure types and compositions after being trained with 10;4 data points. Further, our framework is interpretable because one can extract the contributions from local chemical environments to global properties. Using an example of perovskites, we show how this information can be utilized to discover empirical rules for materials design.},

   abstract = {Conducting polymers are extensively studied due to their outstanding properties, including tunable electrical property, optical and high mechanical properties, easy synthesis and effortless fabrication and high environmental stability over conventional inorganic materials. Although conducting polymers have a lot of limitations in their pristine form, hybridization with other materials overcomes these limitations. The synergetic effects of conducting polymer composites give them wide applications in electrical, electronics and optoelectronic fields. An in-depth analysis of composites of conducting polymers with carbonaceous materials, metal oxides, transition metals and transition metal dichalcogenides etc. is used to study them effectively. Here in this review we seek to describe the transport models which help to explain the conduction mechanism, relevant synthesis approaches, and physical properties, including electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Recent developments in their applications in the fields of energy storage, photocatalysis, anti-corrosion coatings, biomedical applications and sensing applications are also explained. Structural properties play an important role in the performance of the composites.},

Despite the wealth of chiro-optical studies on these materials, their charge-to-spin conversion efficiency is unknown. We demonstrate highly efficient electrically driven charge-to-spin conversion in enantiopure chiral perovskites (R/S-MB)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (〈n〉 = 4), where MB is 2-methylbutylamine, MA is methylamine, Pb is lead, and I is iodine. Using scanning photovoltage microscopy, we measured a spin Hall angle θsh of 5% and a spin lifetime of ~75 picoseconds at room temperature in 〈n〉 = 4 chiral perovskites, which is much larger than its racemic counterpart as well as the lower 〈n〉 homologs. In addition to current-induced transverse spin current, the presence of a coexisting out-of-plane spin current confirms that both conventional and collinear spin Hall conductivities exist in these low-dimensional crystals. Enantiopure two-dimensional perovskites can show high efficiency for charge-to-spin conversion and generate both conventional transverse and unconventional out-of-plane spin currents. Large spin-orbit coupling in Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites enables chirality-induced spin selectivity. Abdelwahab et al. show that four-layer (MB)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (where MB is 2-methylbutylamine and MA is methylamine) has a large spin Hall angle of 5% and a spin lifetime of about 75 picoseconds at room temperature.

   abstract = {General conditions for organic reactions are important but rare, and efforts to identify them usually consider only narrow regions of chemical space. Discovering more general reaction conditions requires considering vast regions of chemical space derived from a large matrix of substrates crossed with a high-dimensional matrix of reaction conditions, rendering exhaustive experimentation impractical. Here, we report a simple closed-loop workflow that leverages data-guided matrix down-selection, uncertainty-minimizing machine learning, and robotic experimentation to discover general reaction conditions. Application to the challenging and consequential problem of heteroaryl Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling identified conditions that double the average yield relative to a widely used benchmark that was previously developed using traditional approaches. This study provides a practical road map for solving multidimensional chemical optimization problems with large search spaces. Chemists typically discover reactions using a small set of relatively similar starting compounds. The conditions that work best for those compounds then get applied to numerous other, often dissimilar, compounds even if alternate conditions might improve outcomes. Angello et al. developed an iterative protocol of machine learning and automated synthesis to improve the baseline conditions for the venerable Suzuki-Miyaura carbon–carbon coupling reaction. Because this method sampled a broad region of chemical space and considered negative results that are rarely tracked in conventional studies, a substantial improvement in average yield was obtained. —JSY Iterating machine learning with robotic experimentation uncovered higher-yielding conditions for a common coupling reaction.},

We showcase the power of this strategy for the challenging problem of speciation of palladium (Pd) catalysts, for which a mechanistic rationale is currently lacking.

   number = {6708},
   pages = {522-528},
   abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides a distinctive view on the three-dimensional structure of crystals. To reconstruct the electron density map, the complex structure factors F=Fexpiϕ of a sufficiently large number of diffracted reflections must be known. In a conventional experiment, only the amplitudes F are obtained, and the phases ϕ are lost. This is the crystallographic phase problem. In this work, we show that a neural network, trained on millions of artificial structure data, can solve the phase problem at a resolution of only 2 angstroms, using only 10 to 20% of the data needed for direct methods. The network works in common space groups and for modest unit-cell dimensions and suggests that neural networks could be used to solve the phase problem in the general case for weakly scattering crystals. Crystallography is one of the core analytical techniques in the natural sciences. Various experimental advancements, such as noise-free detectors, synchrotrons, free-electron lasers, and the three-dimensional electron density electron diffraction technique, have made it possible to conduct fast experiments on weakly scattering, nanometer-sized crystals. However, interpretation of the data, especially determining the structure, still relies on methods that have not seen significant advancements for many decades. Using deep learning neural networks trained with millions of artificial crystal structures and their corresponding synthetic diffraction data, Larsen et al. developed an approach demonstrating exceptionally high predictive capabilities, which produced accurate electron density maps. The framework considered only centrosymmetric space groups, but with further research, it could be extended to other space groups. —Yury Suleymanov},

(p. 643, published online 4 October; see the Perspective by Norris and Aydil) have developed a solid-state cell in which structured films of titania or alumina nanoparticles are solution coated with a lead-halide perovskite layer that acts as the absorber and n-type photoactive layer. These particles are coated with a spirobifluorene organic-hole conductor in a solar cell with transparent oxide and metal contacts. For the alumina particles, power conversion efficiencies of up to 10.9% were obtained. Mesostructured alumina acts as an insulating scaffold for the assembly of very thin films of n- and p-type semiconductors. The energy costs associated with separating tightly bound excitons (photoinduced electron-hole pairs) and extracting free charges from highly disordered low-mobility networks represent fundamental losses for many low-cost photovoltaic technologies. We report a low-cost, solution-processable solar cell, based on a highly crystalline perovskite absorber with intense visible to near-infrared absorptivity, that has a power conversion efficiency of 10.9% in a single-junction device under simulated full sunlight. This ?meso-superstructured solar cell? exhibits exceptionally few fundamental energy losses; it can generate open-circuit photovoltages of more than 1.1 volts, despite the relatively narrow absorber band gap of 1.55 electron volts. The functionality arises from the use of mesoporous alumina as an inert scaffold that structures the absorber and forces electrons to reside in and be transported through the perovskite.},

   abstract = {High-entropy alloys are solid solutions of multiple principal elements that are capable of reaching composition and property regimes inaccessible for dilute materials. Discovering those with valuable properties, however, too often relies on serendipity, because thermodynamic alloy design rules alone often fail in high-dimensional composition spaces. We propose an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data. Our approach works as a closed-loop, integrating machine learning with density-functional theory, thermodynamic calculations, and experiments. After processing and characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions, we identified two high-entropy Invar alloys with extremely low thermal expansion coefficients around 2 × 10−6 per degree kelvin at 300 kelvin. We believe this to be a suitable pathway for the fast and automated discovery of high-entropy alloys with optimal thermal, magnetic, and electrical properties. Invar alloys have extremely low thermal expansion, making them attractive for several types of applications. Finding these types of alloys in a complex compositional space, however, is challenging. Rao et al. used an iterative scheme that combines machine learning, density functional theory, experiments, and thermodynamic calculation to find two new invar alloys out of millions of candidates (see the Perspective by Hu and Yang). The alloys are both compositionally complex, high entropy materials, thus demonstrating the power of this approach for materials discovery. —BG Two high-entropy alloys with extremely low thermal expansion were found with the help of machine learning.},

A tool that gives substrate-adaptive conditions for palladium (Pd)–catalyzed carbon-nitrogen (C–N) couplings is presented. The design and construction of this tool required the generation of an experimental dataset that explores a diverse network of reactant pairings across a set of reaction conditions. A large scope of C–N couplings was actively learned by neural network models by using a systematic process to design experiments. The models showed good performance in experimental validation: Ten products were isolated in more than 85% yield from a range of couplings with out-of-sample reactants designed to challenge the models. Importantly, the developed workflow continually improves the prediction capability of the tool as the corpus of data grows. The palladium-catalyzed coupling of amines with aryl halides is one of the most widely used reactions in pharmaceutical research and manufacturing. Nonetheless, it depends sensitively on the structure of the two coupling partners and therefore often requires a trial-and-error process to identify pertinent optimal conditions. Rinehart et al. trained and validated a machine learning model to predict appropriate ligand, solvent, and base for coupling of particular reactant pairs.

   abstract = {Zeolites are widely used in many industrial applications, but despite decades of research, their synthesis still relies on trial-and-error approaches. Complex nucleation mechanisms and topological diversity lead to strong phase competition, complicating the issue of rational design of zeolite synthesis. Using atomistic simulations, literature mining, human-computer interaction, synthesis, and characterization, Schwalbe-Koda et al. developed a computational strategy that enables a priori control of phase selectivity in zeolite synthesis (see the Perspective by Chaikittisilp and Okubo). This approach uses several metrics for designing organic structure–directing agents to crystallize target zeolites with controlled phase competition and intergrowth. These results may have profound implications for the materials science community if this method is shown to be successful in the synthesis of practically useful uncommon zeolites. —YS A multicomponent simulation method allows control of phase competition in zeolite synthesis, replacing traditional empiricism. Zeolites are versatile catalysts and molecular sieves with large topological diversity, but managing phase competition in zeolite synthesis is an empirical, labor-intensive task. In this work, we controlled phase selectivity in templated zeolite synthesis from first principles by combining high-throughput atomistic simulations, literature mining, human-computer interaction, synthesis, and characterization. Proposed binding metrics distilled from more than 586,000 zeolite-molecule simulations reproduced the extracted literature and rationalized framework competition in the design of organic structure-directing agents. Energetic, geometric, and electrostatic descriptors of template molecules were found to regulate synthetic accessibility windows and aluminum distributions in pure-phase zeolites. Furthermore, these parameters allowed us to realize an intergrowth zeolite through a single bi-selective template. The computation-first approach enables control of both zeolite synthesis and structure composition using a priori theoretical descriptors.},

Our approach is widely applicable to synthesize a range of high-quality layered perovskite nanowires with large aspect ratios and tunable organic-inorganic chemical compositions. These nanowires form exceptionally well-defined and flexible cavities that exhibited a wide range of unusual optical properties beyond those of conventional perovskite nanowires. We observed anisotropic emission polarization, low-loss waveguiding (below 3 decibels per millimeter), and efficient low-threshold light amplification (below 20 microjoules per square centimeter). A templating method enables the growth of two-dimensional metal-halide perovskite nanowires that exhibit polarized photoluminescence and enable low-loss waveguiding. Shao et al. grew nanowires of (BrCA3)2PbBr4, where BrCA3 is 2-(2-bromo-5-carboxyphenoxy)ethan-1-aminium. The carboxylic acid group of BrCA3 inhibited the growth of all crystal facets except [110], which led to one-directional growth. The nanowires also achieved efficient light amplification, with a threshold of less than 20 microjoules per square centimeter. —Phil Szuromi},

   abstract = {Realizing solution-processed heterostructures is a long-enduring challenge in halide perovskites because of solvent incompatibilities that disrupt the underlying layer. By leveraging the solvent dielectric constant and Gutmann donor number, we could grow phase-pure two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite stacks of the desired composition, thickness, and bandgap onto 3D perovskites without dissolving the underlying substrate. Characterization reveals a 3D–2D transition region of 20 nanometers mainly determined by the roughness of the bottom 3D layer. Thickness dependence of the 2D perovskite layer reveals the anticipated trends for n-i-p and p-i-n architectures, which is consistent with band alignment and carrier transport limits for 2D perovskites. We measured a photovoltaic efficiency of 24.5%, with exceptional stability of T99 (time required to preserve 99% of initial photovoltaic efficiency) of &gt;2000 hours, implying that the 3D/2D bilayer inherits the intrinsic durability of 2D perovskite without compromising efficiency. Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskite passivation layers grown on three-dimensional (3D) perovskite can boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells, but spin-coating of these layers usually forms heterogeneous 2D phases or only ultrathin layers. Sidhik et al. found that solvents with the appropriate dielectric constant and donor strength could grow phase-pure 2D phases of controlled thickness and composition on 3D substrates without dissolving them. Solar cells maintained a peak PCE of 24.5% for 2000 hours with less than 1% degradation under continuous light at 55°C and 65% relative humidity. —PDS Solvents enable growth of phase-pure two-dimensional perovskites without dissolving three-dimensional perovskite substrates.},

   abstract = {Contemporary materials discovery requires intricate sequences of synthesis, formulation, and characterization that often span multiple locations with specialized expertise or instrumentation. To accelerate these workflows, we present a cloud-based strategy that enabled delocalized and asynchronous design-make-test-analyze cycles. We showcased this approach through the exploration of molecular gain materials for organic solid-state lasers as a frontier application in molecular optoelectronics. Distributed robotic synthesis and in-line property characterization, orchestrated by a cloud-based artificial intelligence experiment planner, resulted in the discovery of 21 new state-of-the-art materials. Gram-scale synthesis ultimately allowed for the verification of best-in-class stimulated emission in a thin-film device. Demonstrating the asynchronous integration of five laboratories across the globe, this workflow provides a blueprint for delocalizing—and democratizing—scientific discovery. Recent advances in experimental automation and integration with artificial intelligence (AI) have laid the foundation for so-called “self-driving labs,” but in most cases they remained limited to simple proof-of-concept experiments. Strieth-Kalthoff et al. presented their concept of asynchronous cloud-based delocalized closed-loop (ACDC) discovery to drive multiple geographically distributed platforms in a single discovery campaign in which each unit operates as an independent, asynchronous worker executing experiments planned by a central AI entity. The ACDC concept has been successfully applied in the search for organic solid-state laser gain materials with state-of-the-art lasing performance, a challenging scientific problem with slow progress, thereby demonstrating the power of this closed-loop campaign. —Yury Suleymanov},

Current models rely on large data sets that generally do not exist for specialized research fields. We demonstrate a closed-loop workflow that combines high-throughput synthesis of organic semiconductors to create large datasets and Bayesian optimization to discover new hole-transporting materials with tailored properties for solar cell applications. The predictive models were based on molecular descriptors that allowed us to link the structure of these materials to their performance. A series of high-performance molecules were identified from minimal suggestions and achieved up to 26.2% (certified 25.9%) power conversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells. An inverse design approach has identified high-performance organic hole-transporting semiconductors for perovskite solar cells. Wu et al. synthesized libraries of conjugated organics molecules through Suzuki coupling to create large datasets and evaluated these molecules as hole transporters. A Bayesian model was trained on device performance and used to synthesize new candidates based on molecular descriptors.

   abstract = {The band edge of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, which have the general formula ABX3, is mainly controlled by the inorganic X anions (such as chloride) and the B cation (such as lead). Organic A-site cations usually only exert indirect structural effects because their electronic levels lie far from the band edge. Xue et al. show that cations with large π-conjugated structures can interact with inorganic frontier molecular orbitals. A surface layer of ethylammonium pyrene, which had an optimal intercalation distance, increased hole mobilities and power conversion efficiencies relative to a reference inorganic perovskite and also improved device stability. Science, this issue p. 636 Large π-conjugated structures allow A-site organic cations to contribute to the frontier orbitals of hybrid perovskites. The band edges of metal-halide perovskites with a general chemical structure of ABX3 (A, usually a monovalent organic cation; B, a divalent cation; and X, a halide anion) are constructed mainly of the orbitals from B and X sites. Hence, the structural and compositional varieties of the inorganic B–X framework are primarily responsible for regulating their electronic properties, whereas A-site cations are thought to only help stabilize the lattice and not to directly contribute to near-edge states. We report a π-conjugation–induced extension of electronic states of A-site cations that affects perovskite frontier orbitals. The π-conjugated pyrene-containing A-site cations electronically contribute to the surface band edges and influence the carrier dynamics, with a properly tailored intercalation distance between layers of the inorganic framework. The ethylammonium pyrene increased hole mobilities, improved power conversion efficiencies relative to that of a reference perovskite, and enhanced device stability.},

Predicting the stability of the perovskite structure remains a long-standing challenge for the discovery of new functional materials for many applications including photovoltaics and electrocatalysts. We developed an accurate, physically interpretable, and one-dimensional tolerance factor, τ, that correctly predicts 92% of compounds as perovskite or nonperovskite for an experimental dataset of 576 ABX3 materials (X = O2−, F−, Cl−, Br−, I−) using a novel data analytics approach based on SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator). τ is shown to generalize outside the training set for 1034 experimentally realized single and double perovskites (91% accuracy) and is applied to identify 23,314 new double perovskites (A2BB′X6) ranked by their probability of being stable as perovskite. This work guides experimentalists and theorists toward which perovskites are most likely to be successfully synthesized and demonstrates an approach to descriptor identification that can be extended to arbitrary applications beyond perovskite stability predictions.},

Reconfiguring the band-edge states and modulating their interplay with charge carriers at the interface in a continuous manner have long been sought yet are challenging. Here, using organic semiconductor?incorporated 2D halide perovskites as the model system, we realize the manipulation of band-edge states and charge distribution via mechanical?rather than chemical or thermal?regulation. Compression induces band-alignment switching and charge redistribution due to the different pressure responses of organic and inorganic building blocks, giving controllable emission properties of 2D perovskites. We propose and demonstrate a ?pressure gating? strategy that enables the control of multiple emission states within a single material. We also reveal that band-alignment transition at the organic-inorganic interface is intrinsically not well resolved at room temperature owing to the thermally activated transfer and shuffling of band-edge carriers. This work provides important fundamental insights into the energetics and carrier dynamics of hybrid semiconductor heterostructures. Interfacial band states and charge distribution of 2D hybrid heterostructures are continuously manipulated by pressure gating.},

Here, we performed first-principles calculations, revealing that the molecule dissociation energy of Dion-Jacobson (DJ) structure using 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)benzene molecules as bridging ligands is two times higher than the typical Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) structure based on phenylethylammonium ligands. Accordingly, LEDs based on the DJ structure show a half-lifetime over 100 hours, which is almost two orders of magnitude longer compared with those based on RP structural quasi?two-dimensional perovskite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the longest lifetime reported for all organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites operating at the current density, giving the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) value. In situ tracking of the film composition in operation indicates that the DJ structure was maintained well after continuous operation under an electric field.},

   abstract = {Dion-Jacobson (DJ) type 2D perovskites with a single organic cation layer exhibit a narrower distance between two adjacent inorganic layers compared to the corresponding Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, which facilitates interlayer charge transport. However, the internal crystal structures in 2D DJ perovskites remain elusive. Herein, in a p-xylylenediamine (PDMA)-based DJ perovskite bearing bifunctional NH(3) (+) spacer, the compression from confinement structure (inorganic layer number, n = 1, 2) to nonconfinement structure (n > 3) with the decrease of PDMA molar ratio is unraveled. Remarkably, the nonconfined perovskite displays shorter spacing between 2D quantum wells, which results in a lower exciton binding energy and hence promotes exciton dissociation. The significantly diminishing quantum confinement promotes interlayer charge transport leading to a maximum photovoltaic efficiency of approximately 11%. Additionally, the tighter interlayer packing arising from the squeezing of inorganic octahedra gives rise to enhanced ambient stability.},

However, the ever-growing field of optoelectronic devices using 2D HPs requires fundamental understanding of the influence of the spacer on the physiochemical properties and stability of perovskites as well as establish which cation properties are closely related to suppress the halogen ion mobility. This study focuses on investigating the influence of organic spacers with intrinsic properties (e.g., rigidity and flexibility, special groups) and variations of material dimensions on the stability of halogen ions and inorganic frameworks in 2D HPs. It is found that the perovskite structure composed of rigidity molecules owns better stability of halogen ion and inorganic framework than that of flexible molecules. The stability of ions exhibits a negative correlation with the dimensions of perovskite. More importantly, a simple descriptor for measuring the stability of halogen ions in 2D HPs is constructed. By causal discovery algorithms with more physical and chemical significance, the Kappa shape index, number of rotatable bonds, and aromatic carbocycles in organic spacers are identified as causal and important features for the stability of halogen ions in 2D HPs.},
